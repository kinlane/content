title: APIs Are How Our Digital Selves are Learning To Speak With Each Other

I know this will sound funny to many folks, but when I see APIs, I see language and communication, and humans learning to speak with each other in this new digital world we are creating for ourselves. My friend Erik Wilde ([@dret](https://twitter.com/dret)) tweet this weekend a regular reminder for me that APIs are indeed a language.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">APIs are languages. show me one <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/API?src=hash">#API</a> aspect that cannot be adequately framed in the context of language design practices and challenges.</p>&mdash; Erik Wilde (@dret) <a href="https://twitter.com/dret/status/871429314876645376">June 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

Every second on our laptops and mobile phone we are communicating with many different companies and individuals. With each wall post, Tweet, photo push, or video stream we are communicating with our friends, family and public. Each of these interactions are defined and facilitated using an API. An API call just for saying something in text, in an image, or video. 

Uber geeks like me spend their days trying to map out and understand these direct interactions, as well as the growing number of indirect interactions. For every direct communication, there might be numerous indirect communications with advertisers, platform providers, or maybe even law enforcement, researchers, or anyone else with access to the communication channels. We aren't just directly learning to communicate, we are also indirectly participating in conversations we are completely unaware of--unless you are tuned into the bigger picture of the API economy.

When we post that photo, companies are whispering about what is in the photo, where it was taken, and what meaning it has. When we share that news link of Facebook, companies have a discussion about the truthfulness and impact of the link, maybe the psychological profile behind the link and where we fit into their psychological profile. In some scenarios, they are talking directly about us personally like we are sitting in the room, other times they are talking about us like we are just a number in a demographic pool.

In alignment with the real world the majority of these conversations being held between men behind closed doors. Publicly the conversations are usually directed by people with a bullhorn, talking over others, as well as whispering behind, and around people as they are completely unaware that these conversations about them are occurring. The average person is unaware the conversation is happening, can't hear the whispering, or just do not speak the language that is occurring around them, about them, each moment of each day.

Those of us in the know are scrambling to understand and control the conversations that are going on. There is a lot of money to be made when you are part of the conversation. Or at least have a whole bunch of people on your platform to have a conversation about, or around. People don't realize that for every conversation you have online, there are probably 20 conversations going on about your conversation. What will they buy next? Who do they know? What is in that photo they just shared? Is this related post interesting to them? API-driven echoes of conversation upon conversations into infinity.
