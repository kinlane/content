I am stepping back to today and thinking about a pretty long list of API design considerations for [the Human Services Data API (HSDA)](http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/documentation/), providing guidance for municipal 211 who are implementing an API. I'm making simple API design decisions from how I define query parameters all the way to hypermedia decisions for the version 2.0 of the HSDA API.
