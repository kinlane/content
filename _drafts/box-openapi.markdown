Box has gone all in on OpenAPI. [They have published an OpenAPI for the document and storage API on Github](https://github.com/box/box-openapi), where it can be used in a variety of services, and maintained as part of the Box developer platform. Adding to the number of high-profile APIs managing their OpenAPI definitions on Github, like Box, and [the NY Times](http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/).

As part of their OpenaPI release, [Box published a blog post that touches on all the major benefits of having an OpenAPI](https://medium.com/box-developer-blog/embracing-openapi-swagger-at-box-3e9239a57db6), like forking on Github for integration into your workflow, generating documentation and visualizations, code, mocks, and even [monitoring and testing using Runscope](https://www.runscope.com/). It's good to see a major API provider drinking the OpenAPI Kool-Aid, and reduce friction for their developers.

I would love to not be in the business of crafting complete OpenAPIs for API providers. I would like every single one to be maintaining their own OpenAPI on Github like [Box](https://github.com/box/box-openapi) and [NY Times(http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/01/new-york-times-manages-their-openapi-using-github/) does. Then I could spend time indexing, curating, and developing interesting tooling and visualizations to help us tell stories around APIs, helping developers and business owners understand what is possible with the growing number of APIs available today.
