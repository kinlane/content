API Design has matured in the last five years to become a full blown discipline that is impacting every stop along not just the API lifecycle, but also the wider application lifecycle. API design is providing a framework for how we describe, share, and put our data, content, algorithms and other digital resources to work across the web, mobile, and device applications we depend on daily. Setting the standards for what is API in the digital economy.

Let's take a quick look at API design in the context of RESTful API design, but then quickly zoom out to see how API design has grown to include other design patterns like hypermedia, gRPC, GraphQL, and has matured to include governance, policy, and even a regulatory position when it comes to banking, healthcare, and other vital economic areas. API design is much more than just the naming and ordering of the technical details of your API, it is ow something that will impact your APIs at every stop along the API lifecycle from deployment to deprecation.
