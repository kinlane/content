One layer of my API research is dedicated to keeping track on what is going on with API software development kits (SDK). I have been looking at [trends in SDK evolution as part of continuous integration and deployment](http://sdk.apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/), increased [analytics at the SDK layer](http://sdk.apievangelist.com/2016/10/04/increased-analytics-at-the-api-client-and-sdk-level/), and [SDKs getting more specialized](http://sdk.apievangelist.com/2016/09/30/api-sdks-getting-more-specialized/) in the last year. This is a conversation that [Google is continuing to move forward by focusing on enhanced storage, logging, and analytics at the SDK level](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/05/use-Google-Cloud-Client-Libraries-to-store-files-save-entities-and-log-data.html).

Google is a pretty solid example of how API providers increasing the number of resources available at the SDK layer, beyond just handling requests and responses with a variety of target APIs, as well as authentication. I'll try to carve out some time to paint a bigger picture of what Google is doing with SDKs. All their experience developing and supporting SDKs across hundreds of public APIs seems to be coming to a focus with [the Google Cloud SDK effort(s)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).
