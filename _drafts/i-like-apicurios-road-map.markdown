I have been learning more about Apicurio, [which is the open source API design editor I have been waiting for](http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/30/apicurio-is-the-open-source-api-editor-i-was-looking-for/). There are a number of things I'm interested in when it comes to Apicurio, but [one side element that caught my attention was their road map](http://www.apicur.io/roadmap/).
