title: I Wish USA Facts Had A Sophisticated API Embeddable And Sharing Strategy

I love what the folks over at USAFacts have done with their effort to educate us about how the US works (or doesn't). I commend Steve Ballmer for the money he's put into, and the obviously huge amount of work they have put into making some pretty complex things understandable. However, I just have one critique: I wish they had an API, accompanied with a more sophisticated sharing and embeddable approach to publishing the wealth of valuable information contained within the site.
