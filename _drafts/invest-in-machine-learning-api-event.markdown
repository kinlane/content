title: Invest In Machine Learning API Event

I've been curating events going on in the API space beyond APIStrat in Portland this fall ([submit your CFP!!](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/cfp)), and I saw a notification for [PAPIs in SÃ£o Paulo in two weeks, as well as Boston in October](http://www.papis.io/). I'm glad we've always kept @APIStrat a wider community thing, but if I had to pick one vertical to focus on in 2017 and on, it would be machine learning APIs.

[PAPIs has been on my radar for a while now](http://www.papis.io/), but I think their foresight is going to start paying off this year. While there are a number of trends moving the API space forward, things like microservices, serverless, and even GraphQL will compare to what is going to happen with machine learning (ML). I think about 90% of the ML world will be hype, but there will be 5-10% of it that will move industries forward in any meaningful way, and the scope of the investment in everything ML is going to be dizzying for the foreseeable future.
