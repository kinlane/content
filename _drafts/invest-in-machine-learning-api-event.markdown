title: Invest In Machine Learning API Event

I've been curating events going on in the API space beyond APIStrat in Portland this fall ([submit your CFP!!](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/cfp)), and I saw a notification for [PAPIs in SÃ£o Paulo in two weeks, as well as Boston in October](http://www.papis.io/). I'm glad we've always kept @APIStrat a wider community thing, but if I had to pick one vertical to focus on in 2017 and on, it would be machine learning APIs.

[PAPIs has been on my radar for a while now](http://www.papis.io/), but I think their foresight is going to start paying off this year. While there are a number of trends moving the API space forward, things like microservices, serverless, and even GraphQL will compare to what is going to happen with machine learning (ML). I think about 90% of the ML world will be hype, but there will be 5-10% of it that will move industries forward in any meaningful way, and the scope of the investment in everything ML is going to be dizzying for the foreseeable future.

An event like PAPIs is going to become increasingly important to help us sit down and have a conversation about what ML APIs do, or do not do. I see machine learning, cognitive, artificial intelligence and the buzzwords everybody likes to use as simply the algorithmic evolution of the API industry. We will be moving beyond just data and content APIs as the default, and having a robust toolbox of algorithmic resources we can bake into all of our applications will be standard operating procedures. I'm guessing we'll see an increased presence of PAPIs in countries around the globe, as well as other ML and AI API-focused events emerge.
