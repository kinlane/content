I've been curating events going on in the API space beyond APIStrat in Portland this fall ([submit your CFP!!](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/cfp)), and I saw a notification for [PAPIS in SÃ£o Paulo in two weeks, as well as Boston in October](https://twitter.com/papisdotio). I'm glad we've always kept @APIStrat a wider community thing, but if I had to pick one vertical to focus on in 2017 and on, it would be machine learning APIs.
