title: 'It Is Not The Technology: API Monitoring Means You Care'

I was just messing around with a friend online about monitoring of our monitoring tools, where I said that I have a monitor setup to monitor whether or not I care about monitoring. I was half joking, but in reality, giving a shit is actually a pretty critical component of monitoring if you think about it. Nobody monitors something they don't care about. While monitoring in the world of APIsn might mean a variety of things, I'm guessing that caring about those resources is a piece of every monitoring configuration.

This has come up before in conversation with my friend Dave O'Neill of APIMetrics, where he tells stories about developers signing up for their service, running the reports they need to satisfy management, then they turn off the service. I think this type of behavior exists at all levels, with many reasons why someone truly doesn't care about a service actually performing as promised--resulting in the instability, and unreliability that APIs that gets touted in the tech blogosphere.
