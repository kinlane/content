title: More Evangelism And Less Sales Is Needed To Move Forward Banking API Conversation

I was reading [what's behind the hold up of API adoption at credit unions](https://www.cujournal.com/news/whats-behind-the-hold-up-of-api-adoption-at-credit-unions) and I'm reminded (again) of the critical need for API evangelists in the space. I am not talking about advocates for a single API, but more evangelists that reflect my mission as the API Evangelist, but dialed in for specific industries.

To set the stage for you, let me share why I started API Evangelist seven years ago. I began writing about the business, and eventually the politics of APIs because I saw the potential with APIs, but saw that things were not evolving as fast as they could because only technologists were dominating the API conversation. We needed more discussion about the business of doing APIs, and many of the finer political details like security, terms of service, branding, and other concerns of the business leaders who actually controlled the purse strings that would move the space forward at the speed and scale everyone wanted.

To help break the log jam within the federal government, healthcare, and other industries someone needed to help assure business and technical stakeholders of the benefits, with sensible direction regarding how to mitigate the risk. The problem in the banking space is that you have vendors and hype pundits dominating the conversation, and much-needed trust is never established. Banks are extremely risk adverse because of money, but also because of regulations, and when you have just technologist, vendors, and hype analysts stirring the pot, nobody ever really helps alleviate the bank's concerns around security, privacy, and other areas of concern.

I remember sitting down at a table in Vegas with Anthem, Kaiser Permanente, and other health insurance providers who were all business when I sat down, but after an hour or so I convinced them they weren't in my sales pipeline, and the tone changed 180 degrees. They are so used to be sold to and pushed vendor solutions to their problems, they were just seeing APIs as the next vendor product. I help show them I didn't have a product to sell them, and genuinely wanted to help them understand the API potential, and break down the security, business, and other concerns they faced as major players in the space. I have seen this play out over and over, across many different industries, and is something that the waves of enterprise sales teams, vendors, and analysts never fully see and realize is actually gumming up the gears of progress. 

For the last five years, I have been trying to groom up evangelists who could tackle specific industries like finance, healthcare, education, and others, but it is really, really difficult to patch together a consistent paycheck to keep anyone engaged. Plus, it seems to take a certain type of obsessive-compulsive personality to stay dedicated to what is going on. If folks are really interested in clearing some of the gunk that is slowing the progress in the banking and credit union API space, you all should get together and establish some sort of vendor-neutral group to help fund and provide a platform for a financial sector API evangelist to work independently with banks to alleviate their concerns, and help showcase the positive motion forward when it comes to banking APIs--otherwise things are going to continue to sputter and jerk forward at an uncomfortable pace.
