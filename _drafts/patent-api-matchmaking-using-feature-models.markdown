Title:: API matchmaking using feature models
Number:: 09454409
Owner:: International Business Machines Corporation
Abstract:: Software that uses machine logic based algorithms to help determine and/or prioritize an application programming interface's (API) desirability to a user based on how closely the API's terms of service (ToS) meet the users' ToS preferences. The software performs the following steps: (i) receiving a set of API ToS feature information that includes identifying information for at least one API and respectively associated ToS features for each identified API; (ii) receiving ToS preference information that relates to ToS related preferences for a user; and (iii) evaluating a strength of a match between each respective API identified in the API ToS feature information set and the ToS preference information to yield a match value for each API identified in the API ToS feature information set. The ToS features include at least a first ToS field. At least one API includes multiple, alternative values in its first ToS field.
