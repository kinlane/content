Title:: Determining trustworthiness of API requests based on source computer applications' responses to attack messages
Number:: 09462011
Owner:: CA, Inc.
Abstract:: A method includes receiving an application programming interface (API) request from a source computer application that is directed to a destination computer application. An attack response message that is configured to trigger operation of a defined action by the source computer application is sent to the source computer application. Deliverability of the API request to the destination computer application is controlled based on whether the attack response message triggered operation of the defined action. Related operations by API request risk assessment systems are disclosed.
