People often ask me what the best tool for API documentation is. There is no simple answer to this question. It depends a lot on what your API looks like, who your developers are, and what kind of support you can give your content system.

Free and Open Source API Documentation Tools

Di√°na Lakatos has written an excellent description of several free and open source tools that can read the standard API definition formats OpenAPI, RAML, and API Blueprint. In addition, she covers API documentation tools that require non-standard formats, and general purpose open source documentation tools that can be used for API documentation that you may want to consider.

She provides screenshots and links to demos for each of these tools. If you want a quick overview of the tools, scroll to the bottom to read the summary table.
