Throughout 2017, Pershing will expand the number of enterprise and third-party APIs available in its NetXServices API Store. By opening up access to data, Pershing is looking to give advisors the flexibility to select their own customized technology stack, whether it’s Pershing’s own technology, third-party products or the advisor’s own proprietary front-end technology.
