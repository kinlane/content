title: 'Birthday Wishes'
---
I got 3 birthday wishes today from sites that I have signed up for.  Birthdays do not mean much to me, I really do not hold it against anyone for forgetting my Birthday.<br /><br />I really do not look to celebrate my Birthday.  However it does stick in my mind when someone wishes me a Happy Birthday.  It is just one of those subtle little items that I remember.<br /><br />3 different software services I have signed up for using the data I signed up with sent out a Happy Birthday to me.<br /><br />What a great way to reach a users heart and develop a loyal relationship.
