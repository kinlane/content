title: 'Moving on From Outlook'
---
This topic got me blogging again on my personal blog at least.  I recently migrated from Outlook...for good.<br /><br />This doesn't seem like much, but I have been using outlook since I think 1998.  It has been the cornerstone of my online communication for years.  I have each year in a PSD back to 2002. <br /><br />I finally just wanted to get machine independent and I've made the jump to Gmail full time.  <br /><br />We'll see where it goes, so far so good.
