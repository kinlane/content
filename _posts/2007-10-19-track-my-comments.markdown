title: 'Track My Comments'
---
I have had this discussion with a few people at different times. I have also seen other people talking about getting information on their commenting.<br /><br />I would like all comments I make on public sites to tracked as part of my history.  I want to know what I am saying out there.<br /><br />Just like my search history I want to see each and everyday what I say to the general public at large.<br /><br />Should of course be able to search this information and post cloud views of I am doing out there.<br /><br />I post comments on Flickr, Youtube, Blogs, Forums, Q&amp;A Site and many other place.<br /><br />I should be able to see what I have done for the day.
