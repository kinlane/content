Going through my Web History for my Google Profile. A little scary when you look at it. I click into my Web History right from the Google Home Page, well...my IGoogle.<br /><br />First page it shows my search history for the day...starting at 8am.  Hmmm...what to think about this?<br /><br />I look further and I click on the calendar to view other days.  Hmmm...that is what I was looking at last saturday.<br /><br />If you think about it this is pretty scary.  Google knows where I have been and what I am looking at.<br /><br />You know what I really don't care at this point, maybe someday I will. But really if I do something I don't want someone to know about I am not going to do it on my home or work computer logged into Google. C'mon.<br /><br />I kind of like it.  It shows me my trends.  What the hell I am looking at.  It will integrate with my bookmarks.<br /><br />I could create a cloudview of what I do. I would like to be able to share some of my search history with the world. I woul<a href="javascript:void(0)" tabindex="10" onclick="return false;"><span>Publish Post</span></a>d like to share some of my bookmarks with the world.<br /><br />Maybe a neat little public cloudview of what I do on the Internet daily, well what I want the public to see that I do on the Internet daily.
