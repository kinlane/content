title: 'Private Profile Items vs. Public Profile Items'
---
There is a lot of information that exists in a dual format in my public and private life. A lot of what I do I don't mind it being public. That is my personality.<br /><br />However there are items that I have to or want to keep private. These items I usually want to keep completely private or maybe make portions of it private.<br /><br />Therefore a separation between all items I work with to have the option to share or keep to myself. Of course everything defaults to being private unless I set a default setting to say otherwise for that item.
