title: 'Sharing the Revenue'
---
That is awesome that there are social media sites and networks starting to share the revenue with their top content generators.<br /><br />Let's go a step further.  How about you pay me for all valid, professional interaction I have.<br /><br />I should be able to generate video, audio, files, pictures, etc and post them places and share in the revenue from these either being sold or ad revenue from eyeballs.<br /><br />I want to be able to take part in networks and spread the word through linking, commenting, and other forms and for every action I take it works towards and overall return in cash or other compensation.<br /><br />If I generate content and you make money, kick me a piece of the action.
