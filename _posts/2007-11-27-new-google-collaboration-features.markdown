title: 'New Google Collaboration Features'
---
Really impressed with some of the collaboration features Google is rolling out.<br /><br />I noticed a little arrow on the tabs on my IGoogle Home Page.  Noticed you can now edit and share each tab.  Not sure if this was in there before, but it's cool.<br /><br />So I created a tab with elements that I wanted to share with my wife.  I chose to share and emailed it to her, then logged into her account as I can see the tab and all the widgets on it.<br /><br />Pretty huge piece of collaboration.  You can create project, client or group specific tools and share with only those you wish to.<br /><br />Huge for people who live in their Google Home page and really starts people on a path to having a <a href="http://kinlane.blogspot.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface </a>to work from.<br /><br />Also noticed when you edit a tab you can choose a layout for it.  Nice for different layout tabs...1...2....3 column layouts.<br /><br />Very nice Google.
