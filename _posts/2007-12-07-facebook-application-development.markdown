title: 'Facebook Application Development'
---
Been spending more time lately thinking about Facebook Application Development for small businesses.<br /><br />Was reading Andrew McAfee talking about <a class="title" href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee">The Impact of Information Technology (IT) on Businesses and their Leaders</a> and talking about <span class="blogcontenthead">Facebook AS the Intranet.<br /><br />Was also talking with another acquaintance about the usage of Facebook as a learning platform for K-12.<br /><br />I really feel Facebook as a big role to play in the next generation of business and learning.  The youth have adopted it and I think it will grow from there.<br /><br />Has a lot of potential because you can still retain some level of control over your application and leverage the Facebook community to reach your audience.<br /><br />More to come...<br /></span>
