title: 'Amazon Web Services - Simple DB'
---
So I jumped the gun and blogged about the new Amazon DevPay web service and realized I hadn't even mentioned the other latest release from Amazon, the SimpleDB.<br /><br />This is something I have been waiting for.  I was already utilizing Amazon S3 for heavy storage of files, images, and large text blobs.  I use MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server for most back-end databases, however 90% of the time I am using only about 10% of the capabilities available to me.<br /><br />I am looking to add, update, and delete text and numeric data is very small amounts most of the time.<br /><br />SimpleDB is perfect for this type of <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com/">small to medium size web site and application deployment</a>.<br /><br />I am excited about playing around with it more and see if it can become the perfect scalable database platform that I have been looking for.
