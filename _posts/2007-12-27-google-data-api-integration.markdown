title: 'Google Data API Integration'
---
I was syncing up some of my OWS Network systems with the complementing Google systems today.  Such as when you post a blog entry to your blog it will post to Blogger, and when you post an calendar entry to your web site it automatically publishes to Google Calendar. <br /><br />So I started working with the Google Data API, and I noticed when you click on code samples and references it just sends to directly to <a href="http://framework.zend.com/download/gdata">Zend Framework</a>.  They have created Zend GData which gives you read / write access to the Google Data API's. <br /><br />It is a very nice set of PHP classes that allow you to work with Calendar, Spreadsheets, Blogger, CodeSearch, and Base.<br /><br />It saved me a lot of time and energy and gave me nice set of tools to get my systems integrated with Google right away.
