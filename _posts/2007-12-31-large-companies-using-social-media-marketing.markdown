title: 'Large Companies Using Social Media Marketing'
---
Just saw a commercial from Mountain Dew about their new soda creation web site, <a href="http://www.dewmocracy.com/">www.dewmocracy.com</a>.<br /><br />It was another interesting usage of Social Media Marketing that utilizes its pro-users or audience to facilitate research and development (R&amp;D).    They are encouraging customers to go to the web site and help decide certain characteristics of a new Mountain Dew soda.<br /><br />It is a pretty simple web site surrounding a kind of game / soda creation application.  The site is built in .NET, the application looks like Silverlight, but I am not sure.<br /><br />Not really impressed with the campaign overall but it is an interesting usage of these new methods.  <br /><br />Shows that the big co's are embracing these principles, now we need to see more of it in the smaller business arena.
