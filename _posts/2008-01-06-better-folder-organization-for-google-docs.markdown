title: 'Better Folder Organization for Google Docs'

Noticed today that Google slipped in the ability create sub folders now in your Google docs management.<br /><br />Definitely a nice feature to allow me to better organize my Google Docs and keep them meaningful and combined with he search you are able to find exactly what  you need.
