title: 'Embedded Presentations with Google Presentations'
---
I have started building OWS Network system based presentations using Google Docs Presentations.  This helps me explain to customers how they can manage their systems using our tools.<br /><br />I noticed you can now publish the spreadsheet as an embedded presentation.  This is nice for presentations that I will be publishing within sites.<br /><br />I will have to try and see if I can upload these to other sites and / or reference them from other sites.
