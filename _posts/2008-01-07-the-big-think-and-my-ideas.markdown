title: 'The Big Think and My Ideas'
---
I was just playing around with a site called the <a href="http://www.bigthink.com/">Big Think</a>.  It is a Youtube for ideas.  Having various business, social, and whatever ideas flowing out constantly naturally I think this is a great idea!<br /><br />So I setup my profile and I am going to start putting my ideas in here and storing them.<br /><br />I decided long ago to stop keeping them in my notebook and start publishing them.  As I post them I will write a little blog entry about them and put it here.
