Joining the Conversation is one my new catch phrases.  It just sounds good, and it really means so much to me in the 2.0 world.<br /><br />I have seen it so many places lately and describes so much about my approach to <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">Social Media Marketing</a>.<br /><br />Marketing these days is not about broadcasting our message to an audience, it is about joining the conversation.<br /><br />I have had lots of problems with business owners and clients not getting involved in their <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com">web site development</a>, <a href="http://www.oregonlocalsearch.com">online marketing projects</a>, and <a href="http://www.oregonlocalsearch.com">social media campaigns</a>.  They usually just say they don't understand it and want you to do it for them.<br /><br />Joining the Conversation and requiring a site owner to get involved and provide regular interaction with site development and marketing efforts will be a common theme of mine in the future.<br /><br />I just posted about gathering my comments and conversations as I place them using coComment and Firefox Add-on / Web Application combination.<br /><br />Joining the conversation as part of a social media marketing campaign requires oversight and senior involvement from the client.  The message has to be consistent and intelligent and have a voice.<br /><br />The content you place on the Internet will stay there and represent you represent you and your company so it is a form of advertising as stated by Brian Clark of CopyBlogger in his blog <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/content-is-advertising/">If Content is the New Advertising, What does your Advertising say about you?</a><br /><br />You have to put a lot of thought into that as you join the conversation.
