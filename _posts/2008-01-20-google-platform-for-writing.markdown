title: 'Google Platform for Writing'
---
I use the "Google Platform" to help me build and evolve my central "content platform".  For either one project or across all of them.<br /><br />I too am a software developer so I approach very similar.<br />I have been using Google Platform to organize and publish my thoughts for some time now.  I have wanted to start blogging on how I do this and work to organize my thoughts in a way I can share with others.  I was reading<a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/2008/01/development-approaches-to-writing.html"> Development Approaches to Writing?</a>, by Fred Stutzman today about his development process approach to writing.  So let me start with a basic post about this and I will work to refine.<br /><br />Everything starts in Google Notebook, because I can harvest from a web page or blog with just a right click and it keeps the reference to the original piece.  I can also just capture my own thoughts as I am surfing using my firefox add-in as well.<br /><br />I can then organize these "notes" into notebooks by relevancy.  I can further refine and handle the evolution by scripts using the Google Notebook API.<br /><br />Then as information and throughts mature I migrate to Google Docs with a simple right click in Google Notebook.<br /><br />Once in Google Docs I can refine more formally and with the assistance of others if necessary through collaboration.<br /><br />Then I can also organize data in spreadsheets and evolve aspects into presentations.<br /><br />From there I can publish to blogger, PDF, a book or whatever publishing format I wish.<br /><br />I like the Google Platform because of how the applications compliment and work together, however the API is the biggest piece that allows me to work with things programmatically using scripts.
