title: 'Social Media Content'
---
I am stilling sifting through all the blogs I read and information I gather on a clear definition in my mind of what describes all the content I generate around the Internet.<br /><br />My <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_graph_concepts_and_issues.php">social graph</a> is a definition of my relationships and my communication with these people.<br /><br />I have been reading more on the <a href="http://technobabble2dot0.wordpress.com/2007/07/16/social-media-index/">social media index</a> and how you can rate someone using this methodology based upon several key areas:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Blogs</li><li>Multi-Format</li><li>Mini-Updates</li><li>Business Cards</li><li>Visual</li><li>Favourites</li><li>Flexible weighting<br /></li></ul>However this addresses highly public organizations or people with distinct presence.  I have a blog / site that I maintain, but I am no means Techcrunch.<br /><br />What sort of definition describes me and the content I publish all over the place at:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Social Networks</li><li>Video Sharing Sites</li><li>Image &amp; Picture Sharing Sites</li><li>Social Bookmarking Sites</li><li>And much more</li></ul>What single definition describes my user generated content distributed all over the Internet?<br /><br />Once I can define I can continue to define a metric and ultimately a measurement of this presence.
