title: 'Google Playing Around with Offline Usage of Google Docs'
---
Came across a post of Google Blogoscoped today on Google testing using <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-28-n40.html">Google Gears for offline Google Docs access</a>.<br /><br />This would be huge in taking more market share from Microsoft Office.  It would allow users to work with documents much in the same way they do with the desktop Microsoft version.<br /><br />They seem to be only testing it out right now and will be initially making it only available for Google Docs and not for spreadsheets or presentation.<br /><br />This is something I would us a lot, been enjoying it for my Google Reader.
