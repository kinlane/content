I was reading a blog entry by Lisa McNeil called <a href="http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/the-marketers-foray-into-social-media/">The Marketer's Foray Into Social Media</a>, where she talks about her experiences with clients and the top questions they ask.<br /><br />Anyways, the post was great.

I've talked about my frustrations regarding building web sites and applications for clients being very tough because of the lack of involvement on their part.  The standard response is, "just build it I really don't understand this stuff". <br /><br />I keep saying how critical it is for the site owner to be part of the development and understand their site and make it reflect them.<br /><br />This is only getting more and more critical with the need to <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">develop social media marketing strategies</a>.

Train them to execute in house and not use you as a crutch just because your an "employee'.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
