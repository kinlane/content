Itis a company of action sports enthusiasts and media professionals<br /><br />It is perfect for the person who wants to document their active life.<br /><br />Supposively the quality is pretty good.  The camera can record 2 full hours of video on an embedded MicroSD card.  There's also a microphone built-in.<br /><br />Once the recording is complete, it can be uploaded to the <a href="http://www.vholdr.com/videolist">VholdR site</a>, tagged, labeled, and then shared.<br /><br />What is also very cool is the application uses several Amazon Web Services behind the scenes. All of the videos are stored in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>, and the entire <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a>-powered uploading, transcoding, and post-processing system is driven by data stored in a couple of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs">Amazon SQS</a> instances.<br /><br />I'm going to have to test run one of these.
