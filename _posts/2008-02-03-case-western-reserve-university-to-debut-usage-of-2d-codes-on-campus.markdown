title: 'Case Western Reserve University to Debut Usage of 2D codes on campus'
---
I was turned to an article about usage of <a href="http://2d-code.co.uk/qr-codes-on-campus/">QR Codes on Campus</a> over at <a href="http://2d-code.co.uk/">2d-code.co.uk</a>.<br /><br />Beginning February 1st 2008, students, faculty and staff at Case Western Reserve's Cleveland, Ohio, campus will be participating in the nation's first trial of "2D codes"commonly referred to as "QR Codes"by bringing the cell phone technology to campus.<br /><br />The 2D codes, first introduced on campus during fall orientation will be used as a link to mobile content in the form of pictures, music, videos, news articles and other interactive media.<br /><br />For companies, the codes present an avenue for extending the value of their product packaging. For students, the codes are a way to deliver information and entertainment to friends. For professors, they allow a new level of interactivity for engaging the Facebook generation.<br /><br />All faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends of the university who have a case.edu e-mail address can enroll in the pilot beginning February 1st at <a href="http://www.mobilediscovery.com/">http://www.mobilediscovery.com</a>.<br /><br />From this Web site, members of the university community will be able to download to a cell phone the software needed to read the codes, create their own 2D codes and connect the codes to contentfor free. Some wireless carriers may charge users for each code read and content downloaded to the phone.<br /><br />Sometimes I get the feeling the educational institutions are behind the game when it comes to technology, it is nice to see some taking risks and leading.
