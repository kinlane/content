title: 'Firefox Add-On Overcrowding'
---
I use quite a few different Firefox Add-Ons.  I use Amazon S3 Firefox Organizer, EC2 UI, Google Notebook, coCommnet, Shareaholic, just to name a few.<br /><br />My right click, tray and toolbar is just getting very crowded.<br /><br />It would be nice if someone logically built out a framework for these to display.  I hope with Firefox 3.0 coming out they find a solution.<br /><br />It would be nice if I could manage what showed up where.
