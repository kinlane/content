I love drawing elaborate graphs and visuals to try and convey my point. <br /><br />I usually take pictures of my drawings so I have a digital copy, and I have even played with a few smartboards that record my drawings.<br /><br />I came across a web 2.0 whiteboard created by GE today called I<a href="http://imagination3.com/">magination Cubed</a>.
