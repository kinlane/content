title: 'Olympic Committee Rules Out Social Media'
---
Was just reading a post on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> about <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/olympic_committe_rules_revealed.php">Olympic Committe Rules Revealed: No Posting of Media Allowed.</a><br /><br />They say they are embracing blogging because it is a form of personal expression and not a form of journalism.<br /><br />However they are prohibiting the usage of pictures, sound or moving images in any blog or other method.<br /><br />It is amazing that there are still major groups that do not understand the value of social media and want to control and license everything that happens.<br /><br />I am working in social media more and more in the outdoor space with <a href="http://www.altrec.com">Altrec.com</a> and <a href="http://www.greatoutdoors.com">GreatOutdoors.com</a> and I am realizing the huge value of social media to sporting and outdoor events.<br /><br />It is sad to see the Olympic committee feel this way.
