title: 'Bebo Social Networking for Social Media Marketing'
---
Been doing some work on various Bebo Social Network Profiles as part of a social media marketing campaign.  Since I am spending some time here I thought I would share some thoughts and strategy.<br /><br />First off <a href="http://www.bebo.com/">Bebo </a>is a very European focused social network.  There are a lot of US users, but definitely heavy on the European market.<br /><br />I got setup and have my profile all filled out from my social media profile content platform.  Wish I had some data portability tools!<br /><br />Put in a nice picture of myself or my logo, then I went ahead and started a couple of photo albums, and picked the best pictures I have for the first albums.<br /><br />I don't have any video so I didn't do anything there yet.<br /><br />I emailed a handful of friends, coworkers, and business contacts I had to make them mad about joining another social network.<br /><br />I looked through the applications directory to see if there were any relevant applications I could add.  Bebo had some nice Widget hooks which I will play with later.<br /><br />They have a whiteboard feature which is unique.  You don't see this many places, it is kind of like the wall...but you can draw.  I just posted one myself.<br /><br />I went to my central company blog on this topic and found a couple of the latest blog posts and and made links to the articles.<br /><br />Next I went ahead and did a search on a couple of keywords that are relevant to what I am doing.  Several groups came up and I went ahead and either became a Fan or a Member.  Which gives me some eyeballs on their profile and starts some potential relationships.<br /><br />That was all I did.  I am going to write-up a formal strategy for business <a href="http://www.socialsquad.com/">social networking strategy</a> using Bebo as marketing of your social media strategy.<br /><br />Then I will work on a social media maintenance strategy for your Bebo social networking account.
