title: 'Google Talk Chatback Website Widget'
---
I was just playing with the new <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/google-talk-chatback.html">Google Talk Chatback Widget.</a>  It allows you to allow anonymous chats from your web page for your customers and site visitors. <br /><br />I was just researching using this last week for a client who was asking for it and didn't much care for the Boldchat they were using.<br /><br />It is a great FREE or low cost web site chat and support module.  Just yet another innovative use for the Google Platform.  I use the Google services for so much these days.<br /><br />I went ahead and added to my web site, since I leave my Gmail open all day and live in my Google Desktop it was a natural fit to have on my blog.
