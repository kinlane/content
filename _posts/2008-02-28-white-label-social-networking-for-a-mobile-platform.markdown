title: 'White Label Social Networking for a Mobile Platform'
---
I have been playing with Ning a lot lately and really pushing it to see its potential for a rapid social network deployment.<br /><br />It is very powerful and gives you a huge amount control over setting up a social network.<br /><br />Now I heard about a new white label social networking platform for mobile and handhelds.  It is called <a href="http://www.iamotaimpact.com/en/">iamota impact</a>. <br /><br />It allows you to:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Quickly and easily create and launch mobile services.</li><li>Add mobile "Opt-ins" to many types of media: Web, blogs, email, social networks, TV, print, billboards, bus boards, on-product, radio, POS, live events </li></ul>And it gives you:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Single interface to power mobile marketing, messaging, social networking, location-based services, content delivery and payment </li><li>Handles all wireless carrier certifications, device-specific content optimizations, digital rights management, carrier and Mobile Marketing Association rules </li><li>Open API and custom mobile services </li><li>Financial clearing and settlement </li><li>Reporting and statistics </li></ul>It looks like the start of a pretty sweet service.  It is a little pricey, but as we see more competition in this space I think we'll see more FREE and low cost solutions.
