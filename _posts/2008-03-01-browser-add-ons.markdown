title: 'Browser Add Ons'
---
I am pretty addicted to to Firefox Browser Add-Ons.  I have many of them to the point of add-on overload.<br /><br />I use them for adding items to my Google Notebook, Amazon S3, CoComment, and much more.<br /><br />I syndicate and share to many social networks, social bookmarking, and other sharing sites.<br /><br />I do all this through Firefox.  So recently I have been using Firefox for a primary business function which requires a cookie.  So I need to use Internet Explorer for my personal online view. <br /><br />I pay attention to my Google Information and other stuff.  All of a sudden I feel lost without my add-ons.  I try to right click to add things to my Google Notebook, I try to share.  NOTHING.<br /><br />So I go to search the Internet Explorer Add-Ons.  There really isn't much?  Whats the deal?<br /><br />Why is there such a movemtn behind firefox on this?  I couldn't live without my browser and add-ons?  Is this not ordinary?<br /><br />Internet Exlporer still has like 60+ % market share.  Why isn't there a browser add-on movement?<br /><br />I am working on the specs for a firefox add-on specification.   I worry that mainstream doesn't get it and will never adop browser toolbars and add-ons.<br /><br />Browser Tools have become more important to me than desktop tools.  The only desktop tools I stil use are Dreamweaver.    Everything else is in my browser.<br /><br />I know I am not the normal.  Is this weird.<br /><br />Just trying to understand why Internet Explorer with such huge market share does not have the add-on following?
