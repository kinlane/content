title: 'Why We Give More Weight to Facebook Application Development Over MySpace'
---
I was just reading <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/03/04/myspace-developer-platform-jim-benedetto-myspace/" rel="bookmark">MySpace Developer Platform: Jim Benedetto, MySpace </a>on Jeremiah Owyang's blog.  He is at the Social Graph Conference in San Diego.  I wish I was there.<br /><br />Anyways he was posting a bunch of information about the MySpace development platform and it really shows an impressive approach on their part in reaching out to the developers community. <br /><br />Their approach is much better than Facebook.<br /><br />Yet we still give more priority to building Facebook apps and maintaing our presence there than we do on MySpace.<br /><br />It is primarily because of the demographics.  It will be interesting to see who stays ahead in the Social Networking race.
