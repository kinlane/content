title: 'Google Launches a Contacts Data API'
---
I have been getting happier with the contact management tools available in Gmail...and some of the integration with other Google Applications.<br /><br />I would like to see more social networking and social graph management tools, like their recent social graph api release.<br /><br />Now Google has added another simple, yet powerful tool to their API arsenal.  A common contact list has helped power applications like Gmail, Google Reader, and Google Calendar, and with the launch of the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/">Google Contacts Data API</a>, you can access this list with other external applications.<br /><br />Based on AtomPub, the Contacts API can be used to read, create, edit, and delete contact information stored with Google.<br /><br />Learn the details from an <a href="http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/3-2-1-contact-api-has-landed.html">announcement post</a> on the Google Data APIs blog.
