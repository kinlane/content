title: 'Alltop...Guys Latest...'
---
Was just checking out <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki's</a> latest project <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a>.<br /><br />The site layout instantly sucked me in.<br /><br />Couldn't get past the grey bar layer at first.   Actually after i got over it....it forced me to really focus on the content.....interesting approach.<br /><br />The sites that are already in my sights within the categories I care about were nothing new.  However the introduction to a few new categories was nice.<br /><br />Fresh information....fresh approach.<br /><br />Thanks.
