title: 'Youtube Approach to their New API'
---
I wrote earlier about Youtube's new API.   I am really happy they updated it.  It has several features that I feel are key to using their platform.<br /><br />However in thinking more about it and reading other posts about it I realize their approach and openness is the real gem. <br /><br />Youtube understands the basic 2.0 concept that user activity should not have to occur on your site.  This is a very tough concept for some players to understand.<br /><br />Key player still think that they can force or entice customers to join their social network, use their tools, and participate in activities only on their site.<br /><br />Understanding that you need a quality site presence as well as a quality presence on the open Internet.<br /><br />Google and Youtube gets this and made their API refelect this.  You don't have to upload, search, and view videos on Youtube.
