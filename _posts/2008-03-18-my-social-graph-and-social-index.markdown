title: 'My Social Graph and Social Index'
---
So I have several spurts in trying to understand, track, and ultimately evolve my social graph and my social index.<br /><br />For anyone not following these areas of study, here are some definitions:<br /><br /><strong>Social Graph Definition:</strong>  Social Graph is the network of connections that exist through which people communicate and share information.<br /><br /><strong>Social Index Definition -</strong> Social Index is a measurement of the value, size and velocity of a social graph.<br /><br />I have tried several ways to track my social graph and social index, and recently there has been several tools released to assist.  Such as <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Google Social Graph API</a>, <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/kinlane/">MyBlogLog</a>, <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>, and <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.<br /><br />I'm sure there are more that I am forgetting about.  These tools all provide some missing link in tracking my social graph and its value.  I'm still trying to pull it all together, but unfortunately it is becoming like managing my social networks, I 'm developing fatigue.<br /><br />Defining my social graph fatigue!  It is getting clearer than ever before, but I still need to squint to see anything even slightly clear.<br /><br />More to come on this...
