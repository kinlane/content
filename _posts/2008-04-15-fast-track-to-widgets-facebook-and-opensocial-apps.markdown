title: 'Fast Track to Widgets, Facebook, and OpenSocial Apps'
---
I have been deploying large amounts of widgets, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook </a>and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a> applications to various social networks and platforms lately.<br /><br />Even though I am a programmer I have been able to do much of my heavy lifting using tools that are already available to me without any programming at all.<br /><br />I use a combination of <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and other social media content platforms.  I then syndicate using their native tools and build widgets using <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com">Widgetbox</a>.  Once I have my widgets deployed on Widgetbox I can then easily deploy to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.%20bebo.com">Bebo</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">IGoogle</a>, <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> and any other platform that embraces OpenSocial.<br /><br />I am putting together a series of slides based upon this process for others to use.  Look for another post regarding this process.
