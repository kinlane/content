title: 'RSS Feeds for All Businesses'
---
I know I've ranted about this before, but here we go again.  It cannot be said enough.   EVERY business that has a web site and has information on the Internet needs to provide RSS Feeds for that data.<br /><br />I am looking for product review web sites right now.  Looking to harvest data on different product areas and feed it back out to users.  I am not looking to harness the traffic, it will go to the source of the reviews.  I do this to get data and statistics and ultimately provide value to end-users.<br /><br />4 out of 5 sites I come across have reviews but do not have an RSS Feed.  I understand that some people are worried about their proprietary data, well.....get over it.  RSS will generate new users and syndicate your content beyond your web site.<br /><br />If you can't figure out how to have an RSS feed, go get a Wordpress blog and start using that!!
