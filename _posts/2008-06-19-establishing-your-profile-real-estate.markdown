title: 'Establishing Your Profile Real Estate'
---
I think I've talked on this topic before.  I am going through and setting up a series of MySpace profiles for a client and establishing several "conversational" profiles so they can reach a certain audience.<br /><br />I am amazed at even MySpace how many good URL user names are still available.  An example is http://www.myspace.com/kinlane/ which is the URL representation of your MySpace profile.<br /><br />It is much like securing the domain name for your company.  You should go to all major and even some minor social networks and sites and secure your username. <br /><br />Even if you don't actively use the account, make sure and secure it so that you have the name and login for the future.  You never know when a network or application will go viral and having your company name or your industry / product name can become very valuable.<br /><br />Think if you had http://www.myspace.com/traveling/   or something similar.  It would be very valuable.
