title: 'Social Network Account / Profile Management'
---
We offer social network account and profile management to our clients on a regular basis.  It is a lot of work to maintain your social network profile.<br /><br />I find I can spend a good hour a day on MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn for my own personal profile.  I didn't even touch my other profiles such as Orkut, Bebo, Hi5, Mashables, Fast Company, and on and on.<br /><br />Just making sure your account is logged into everyday and your profile is fresh is a lot of work.<br /><br />Next I try to find new business contacts (friends), joing groups, and find other relative content and contacts to whatever I do.<br /><br />I try to setup and kick off most social network account management contracts for clients so I get in tune with the area we are targeting and try to set the tone for the account management.  It helps me give direction to the employee / contractor who will actually be implementing the daily part of the social media marketing campaign.<br /><br />Really this could be a full time job for someone if a company really wants to have a big presence and connect with people daily, but I find at least a little time each week is what really matters.
