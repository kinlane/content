title: 'Quick Launch RSS from Blog on Web Site'
---
I was looking for a quick way to get our <a href="http://blog.socialmediasquad.com">Social Media Squad</a> blog on the home page and feature area on our new Social Media Squad web site.<br /><br />I wanted it to be a real-time feed, so I chose to go with a <a href="http://itde.vccs.edu/rss2js/build.php">JavaScript RSS Feed</a>, and I quickly found <a href="http://itde.vccs.edu/rss2js/build.php">Feed2JS</a>.  <br /><br />I was able to select:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>URL of the RSS Feed</li><li>Number of items to display</li><li>Amount of RSS description to show</li><li>Show item posting date</li><li>Open links in a new window<br /></li></ul>I is nice to just find quality simple tools available out there in cyberspace that you can use to make your life easier...and get work done.
