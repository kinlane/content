title: 'Test Driving co.mments.com'

I was just test driving a new bookmarking and comment tracking tool called co.mments.com.  I test drive these types of web services to see if there is a fit for use on social media marketing campaigns.<br /><br />It is a pretty simple straightforward approach...which I like.  I prefer applications to do one thing and do it well.<br /><br />The tool has me bookmark my conversations as apposed to CoComment which is a firefox add-on and just tracks comments I place automatically.<br /><br />Maybe the tool needs mature a little and get a firefox add-on and some other bells and whistles.  Then I could possibly find a use for it.  Until then CoComment does the trick.
