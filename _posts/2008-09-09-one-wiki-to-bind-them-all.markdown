title: 'One Wiki to Bind them All'
---
I have been using wikis a lot lately to layout strategy for social media marketing campaigns.  Social media marketing really overlaps into a lot of different areas, some are internal and some are external.<br /><br />So we are designing what we call "online ecosystem" strategies for companies that help visualize all of their online virtual real estate. <br /><br />Using a simple wiki you can layout all the elements of your online presence from your web site and blog to your Facebook and Youtube channels.<br /><br />With this strategy a vision of your virtual real estate will come into focus and you can start bringing them under one unifying strategy that will help you maximize your presence on this valuable real estate you possess.
