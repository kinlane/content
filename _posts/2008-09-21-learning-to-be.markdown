I have trouble sitting still and watching TV let alone something as simple as reading a book or playing a card game.  I think somewhat started with being young and somewhat ADHD.<p></p>
I don't put the blame there, it lies with myself and my obsessive-compulsive personality and feeling a need to always have a business or startup and always striving to learn and be part of the latest trend.<p></p>
Now that I'm 36 and had some big shifts in my life I am retraining myself.  Kaia and I laid around this morning and I read some of my book, we played cards, and just laid in bed and talked.<p></p>
This week I am going to take some more time in this area.
