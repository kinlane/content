title: 'Wiki Publishing'
---
I have used several wiki environments to develop projects and provide oversight for several social media marketing campaigns.<p></p>
I am currently using Google Sites pretty heavily for writing several books and for building my strategy for work. I spend a great deal of time cultivating and gardening the wiki to keep up to date and keep my overview.<p></p>
I would like a simple publish or build feature allowing me to choose from Sitemap which sections and pages I would like to publish and have it create an output format from my selection.<p></p>
Then I could choose to publish as PDF, HTML or other popular format. Can you please get that built Google. Appreciate it.
