I have been using a combination of Dreamweaver and Notepad to do my code editing for a few years now. I use Dreamweaver because of employers mandating it mostly. I really don't like the application, or use many of the features.<p></p>
With my new role at WebEvents Global I started using Homesite which I don't much care for either.<p></p>
A couple developers are using Eclipse, so in order to support it I went ahead and downloaded it. Only using for 30 minutes now and I love it. It is really flowing and smooth in operation. its quick and has lots of bells and whistles.<p></p>
More to come on it I"m sure...
