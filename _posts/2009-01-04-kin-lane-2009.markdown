I am starting a new personal tradition. I have never really been into new years resoutions, but I do get excited about the new possibility of each coming here. I also tend to look for ways to measure up the ending year and see what I accomplished.<p></p>
I am writing a list of what is real importatnt to me personally and professionally at the moment, and things I would like to do for the following year.<p></p>
I am rewriting my personal bio as well. This is the overview I post to most of my social network and business profiles on and offline.<p></p>
Hopefully this can help give me something to work towards as well as be able to measure up what I accomplished over the year.
