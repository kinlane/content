title: 'Netflix on Demand'
---
I finally signed up for Netflix again to get movies in the mail. What spurred me on was hearing they had done PLay on Deman.<p></p>
I was taking a break in a lodge in Southern Oregon the other day and needed to watch movies so I kicked it on. I have been on it ever since.<p></p>
I tend to really like a separate distraction as I work. For some reason it helps me focus? Not sure why.<p></p>
Usually I listen to NPR while working...but there are only so many programs. So I move onto This American Life.<p></p>
Now I discovered the PBS documentaries on Netflix. I can listen...and take short breaks to watch in my other monitor.<p></p>
Man...the Internet is really becoming what I envisioned in the early days.
