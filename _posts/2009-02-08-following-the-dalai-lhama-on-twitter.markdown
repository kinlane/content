title: 'Following the Dalai Lhama on Twitter'
---
I started following the Dalia Lhama on Twitter today. He already has 11K followers and they seem overwhelmed by the response somewhat. You can follow the Dalai Lhama at <a href="http://twitter.com/ohhdl">http://twitter.com/ohhdl</a><p></p>
I had a funny thought as I was following. Not saying the Dalai Lhama has any relation or similiarities to God, but in my limited religious experience when I was a kid I envisioned praying very much like Twitter. With god following all of us and we follow him.<p></p>
I just think that twitter client isn't as standardized as twitter. :)
