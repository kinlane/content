title: 'Keep on Blogging and Twittering'
---
I am finding renewed energy for blogging and twittering lately...mostly because I have more time on my hands living way out in the woods.<p></p>
I used to really worry about the traffic to my blog and building a following, etc. That really gets in the way.<p></p>
If I just focus on what I am working on and what is important to me it seems to work better. Then like minded people tend to find my postings on search engines, twitter and other places.<p></p>
Last night I was working to recover from an Amazon Web Service glitch I talked about earlier. And the Gtalk chat module blipped from my web site. I responded and kept working.<p></p>
It was a nice gentleman from Dublin that was deploying a software as a service (SaaS) CRM tool. He was asking about how to perform search on twitter programmatically. Then he asked other advice about what they should to to market their tool.<p></p>
I really enjoy these kinds of contact, people with real questions, problems and just wanting a sounding board. And they respect my time as well.<p></p>
All of this because i tend to blog and tweet about my random thoughts and feelings regarding technology.
