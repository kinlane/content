title: 'Updating My Status'
---

</div>
Was just playing around more with helltxt which is a multi-social network status update tool. I had come across it a long time ago but never really got the time to play with it.<p></p>
Now I update my status enough across Myspace, <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and Linkedin enough that that the tool sounds intriguing.<p></p>
I tend to star and label new applications I find in my <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Reader" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> so I can find and review later. So I just dug it up and started playing again.<p></p>
Its a very well done application. Allows you to add all the relevant <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social networks</a> you use one by one. Even with as complex as adding a Facebook application can be...they made it very easy.<p></p>
Simple easy to use web interface. And they offer all the other necessary entry points such as mobile, email, sms, instant message.<p></p>
They are what I call the perfect 2.0 application, they chose to do one thing...and they do it well. I highly recommend checking it out.
