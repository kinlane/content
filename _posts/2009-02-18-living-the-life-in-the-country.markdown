title: 'Living the Life in the Country'
---
I have moved out to the woods to live for a while.   After living last summer in Bend, OR I have decided to live a little more remote.

I spent a lot of last summer out wining and dining clients, partying and just generally enjoying the Bend scene.

This summer I am going to try a different approach.  I am working on finding a work / life balance that works for me.  Finding time to work hard on some projects while exploring the outdoors as well.

So far I am loving my new place and some of the people I have met.  The weather is still cold....some snow...but overall it is a great start.  

More to come...
