title: 'Domain Names'

<p style="text-align: left;">So I am continuing cleaning up my world. I recently let probably 20-30 domains expire. In the past I have had a domain adiction....I just buy them thinking...someday I will do something with that.
<p style="text-align: left;">I know plenty of other geeks who do this. You just think....$10.00 for a domain...I can afford that!
<p style="text-align: left;">Then 50-100 domains later you start questioning. What is wrong with me. Then you check-in to Betty Ford Clinic.
<p style="text-align: left;">So anyways...I let a whole bunch of domains expire that I have registered with GoDaddy. In Janurary as I was getting the flood of emails saying each domain was expiring I somehow let www.kinlane.com expire. DOH!
<p style="text-align: left;">Then I go into GoDaddy and they have a recover domain option. However it costs $90.00!! What the hell.....I spent so much money on domains it is hard to believe they now charge to recover a domain registration. Many times in the past when this happens for clients I just call and say I need to renew...and they just charge for renewal. Not recovery.
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm a little disappointed GoDaddy.<p></p>
