title: 'LinkedIn Better Organized for Reaching Audience'
---
I am spending about 30 minutes each day extending my companies reach onto popular social networks LinkedIn and Facebook. I reallky find LinkedIn is much more organized for such business efforts.<p></p>
It is much easier to reach people through LinkedIn QA. It allows me to ask questions and answer questions on topics that are relevant to my industry and company.<p></p>
Facebook is great for interacting with friends, but LinkedIn is just better suited for business networking.<p></p>
I don't think this is anything really new. Just sharing my experience as I am having it.
