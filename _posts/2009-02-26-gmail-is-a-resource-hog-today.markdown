title: 'Gmail is a Resource Hog Today'
---
What is the deal with Gmail today?   Both my free gmail and google apps for my domain are total resource hogs.

After opening either of them my processor goes to about 51% usage and stays there....as soon as I close it goes down to 12-15% with all my other applications.

I have these 2 email applications open every day with no problem.  I haven't added anything new?   Whats up??
