title: 'Internet Is Where I Want It'
---
I remember back in 2001 right after my daughter was born I was building a house in Southern Oregon and decided to spend part of the summer traveling around Oregon. So I setup my laptop as a server so I could still work while I was travelling. Then I had a dial-up modem for my laptop. I would get 9-18k.<p></p>
After building the house in Southern Oregon and the crash was well under way I had to move back to Eugene and find a job. I was crashing in my VW bus around Eugene and tapping Internet from the University of Oregon and select wifi hotspots that were around (very few).<p></p>
Tonight I was getting ready to do some bundling of Amazon EC2 Instances and my Internet just went down. So I went ahead and tethered to my Verizon Blackberry and connected to the Internet. I was curious what sort of speed I was getting.<p></p>
So I am getting 870K down and 98K up here in Blue River Oregon over my cell phone. I'm out in the sticks.<p></p>
The Internet is slowly getting where I want it.
