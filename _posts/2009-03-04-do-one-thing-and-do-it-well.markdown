title: 'Do One Thing and Do it Well'
---
I have always preferred developing web applications that are simple. So many times a project gets blown out in scope and gets way too complicated.<p></p>
I remember specifying a site one time that I gave a 40K bid for. Got the project....then 6 months later through scope creep it was done and the budget was 250K. Then 6 months after launch it was abandoned because it was to complex to use.<p></p>
So I am always advocating a <a href="http://singlefunction.com/showcase/">simple tool or web application</a> that is easy for users to understand and use.<p></p>
Looks like there are other like minded individuals, here is a web application I found that showcases other "Single Function" web sites and applications.<p></p>
It is appropriately called <a href="http://singlefunction.com/showcase/">Single Function</a>.
