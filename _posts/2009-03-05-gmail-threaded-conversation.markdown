title: 'Gmail Threaded Conversation'
---
I have been using my company outlook for the day because for some reason my left hand menu in Gmail (Apps for my Domain) takes up 3/4 of the screen?  I can't figure out why, anyways it gives me a headache.

So I switched to use my Outlook which I maintain because so many people in the company use it.  Although I have been clean and sober from Outlook since 2006.   

One thing that immediately frustrated me is the lack of threaded conversations.  I hated that about Gmail at first, and now it makes me mad to not have it.

It is funny that it is the first feature I can't live without.  I have heard others who were frustrated by it when switching to Google.
