title: 'Event Social Footprint'
---
I am playing around with different formulas for exploring and quantifying an event or conferences social media footprint.<p></p>
Definition of event social media footprint:<p></p>
A way of determining the social network and social media reach of an event before, during and after the event.<p></p>
This is an important area that I believe needs to be evaluated for determining the success of an event.<p></p>
The presence of an event of top social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and top social media sites such as Youtube, Flickr and other sites such as Twitter, FriendFeed is critical these days.<p></p>
I have been working on several tools for evluating this social media footprint and viewing this data.<p></p>
I am using SXSW Interactive as a great test candidate, this is an amazingly innovative crowd and perfect place to dial this in.<p></p>
More to come...
