title: 'Amazon as a Platform Paying Off'
---
My boss passed on a compliment today she received from our customer. We have a legacy CRM / Customer Care Tool that we launch every year. This system uses a large amount of data and is very web server and data server intensive.<p></p>
Historically I guess it had been pretty slow, and a chore to use somewhat. <p></p>
We are completely migrated to Amazon EC2 and S3 as our technology platform. Things have been stable and I'm working hard on other new code and application related initiatives. <p></p>
To support this CRM solution I scaled up the web server to use a larger instance and already had the supporting database server on an x-large instance. <p></p>
The customer and their users raved about the performance of the application this year as opposed to complaining about it.<p></p>
Definitely feels good after all the stress of migrating the entire company infrastructure to the Amazon platform.
