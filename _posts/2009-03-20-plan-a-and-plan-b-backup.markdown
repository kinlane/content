title: 'Plan A and Plan B Backup'
---
I've learned a lot working in the clouds. One of the most important things I've learned is the need for backups. And not just one backup. Lots of them.<p></p>
You need to backup operating systems and configurations using Amazon bundling to AMI.<p></p>
Also in addition to backing up everything to Amazon S3 every night I have adopted a plan B as well. I am now backing up to the Rackspace cloud as well.<p></p>
This provides me with not only the latest backup and previous versions, it gives me another completely redundant layer to all my backups.<p></p>
Peace of mind...
