title: 'Understanding Everything 2.0'
---
I work real hard to read and learn more each day about emerging trends and technologies. There is a lot of information in my head about all this. However putting it down for others to use and understand is extremely difficult for me. It is a constant challenge.<p></p>
Then I come across post by Dion Hinchliffe's blog postings. He constantly amazes me in his ability to articulate this stuff. Through words and his wonderful, distinct visuals.<p></p>
I came across 3 postings of his today that I think you all should read:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/50_essential_strategies_for_creating_a_successful_web_20_pr.htm">50 Essential Strategies For Creating A Successful Web 2.0 Product</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/ten_aspects_of_web_20_strategy_that_every_cto_and_cio_shoul.htm">Ten Aspects of Web 2.0 Strategy That Every CTO and CIO Should Know</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/how_to_survive_and_thrive_in_business_today_with_web_20__p.htm">How to Survive and Thrive in Business Today with Web 2.0 - Part 1</a></li>
</ul>
If you need to get your bearings in all this social media, social networking and new media world...pay attention to Dion and his blog.
