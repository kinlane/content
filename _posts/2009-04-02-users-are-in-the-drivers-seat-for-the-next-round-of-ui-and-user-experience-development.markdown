title: 'Users are in the drivers seat for the next round of UI and user experience development'

Users are quickly moving into the drivers seat when it comes to determining how a web application should look, feel and function.<p></p>
Take the recent Facebook revolt where users banded together and made it clear that they do not like the new Facebook layout.<p></p>
I don't think this was a single case where you have such a passionate base of users that they made their voice heard. I think this is the beginning of a trend.<p></p>
I feel that application and cloud developers need to start building into their development cycle the integration of their users and their feedback. What do they want? How should it work?<p></p>
There are enough power users who understand and get it, they will let you know.<p></p>
Get ready for the age of user driven and crowdsourced web application development. That is just the user interface, you should be integrating developers with a good API, Widget Platform, and overall developers layer to your applicaiton.
