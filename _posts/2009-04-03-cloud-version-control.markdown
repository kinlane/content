title: 'Cloud Version Control'
---
I just did some investigation into some verisoning issues with a system we are developing. Something I do regularly. As I was waiting for the SVN repository to update I was reading some Cloud Computing articles.<p></p>
It made me think how I would really like some sort of version control for all my cloud activities. I would like it to remember every instance I launch, setting, data manipulation, sync, transfer.<p></p>
Basically anything i do regarding my cloud architecture I would like it to log and remember. As well as have a logging for every person involved in my architecture.<p></p>
Wonder how this could be applied to alleviate data and privacy concerns with the cloud and its use in government and corporate applications.
