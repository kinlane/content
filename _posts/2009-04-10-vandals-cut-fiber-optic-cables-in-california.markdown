title: 'Vandals Cut Fiber Optic Cables in California'
---
Was just watching on the Rachel Maddow show about how a fiber optic cable was cut in San Jose and San Carlos. Then I searched and found an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/us/10brfs-VANDALSCUTPH_BRF.html?ref=us">New York Times</a>.<p></p>
Good example of how we need more security and redundancy in our networks.<p></p>
This is right after it ws reported that hackers from Russia and China infiltrated our Electric and other utility grids.<p></p>
Lots of work we need to do.
