Another great post from Dion Hinchliffe @ ZD Net.....<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=334">Determining the ROI of Entrpise 2.0</a><p></p>
Each of Dion's articles leave me processing the links and information for days. Every IT director should be following his blog.<p></p>
Excellent advice as you are trying to figure out how to navigate the migration to Enterprise 2.0 and into the clouds.
