title: 'My Data in the US or EU Cloud'
---
<p id="__mce">I was sitting in a pub last night drinking a beer and organizing my home photos so I could share with my ex-wife.<p></p>
I was uploading images in various zipped folders into different buckets in my <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon S3" rel="homepage" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> storage in the cloud.<p></p>
I was also uploading various zipped folders from my web application development businesss I ran for 8 years. All the project, accounting and business information for all that time.<p></p>
While this was going on I was ready a document from the <a href="http://www.csis.org" target="_blank">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> called <a href="http://www.csis.org/component/option,com_csis_pubs/task,view/id,5157/" target="_blank">Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency</a>. Geeky I know. It is a good read though.<p></p>
I am reading about the legal challenges facing us operating in the cloud. It is huge, a big game changer.<p></p>
So as I am creating buckets my <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247">Amazon S3 Firefox Add-on S3</a> Fox asks me "Place this Bucket in <a class="zem_slink" title="Europe" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">Europe</a>".  Just like that I can put data in the US or in Europe. How does that affect my data, privacy, security, and laws?<p></p>
Say I was doing something illegal with all this data, what protections do I have. Or how vulnerable am I now?<p></p>
Would I be better off putting my data in the US Cloud or the European Cloud?<p></p>
Lots of questions to be answered in the future.<p></p>
