title: 'Taxes in the Cloud'
---
I am last minute e-filing my taxes because my accountant just told me my extension was denied cause they say someone already filed using my SSN? Whole other issue.<p></p>
So I am working using an online software and it is pretty slow, but that expected because its 4/15.<p></p>
So I ask myself....are they scaling their infrastructure in the clouds?<p></p>
