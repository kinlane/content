title: 'Google&#039;s is Creating a Very Robust Cloud Platform'
---
I have been playing around with some <a href="http://cloud.kinlane.com">research on cloud computing</a> lately. I am using the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a> Platform as a base to store and present all the data.<p></p>
I used Google as a Platform when I was doing my social media marketing business. It gave me a ready to go platform to collaborate on without building something from scratch.<p></p>
I am enjoying trying to retrofit it to work as a solid business platform, because of this I am looking at it in some very different ways.<p></p>
If you look at it from a high level you really see a lot of pieces coming together as a robust toolset to operate in the clouds.<p></p>
So I start with Google Apps for My Domain, it gives me:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Email</li>
	<li>Docs</li>
	<li>Calendar</li>
	<li>Sites</li>
</ul>
It gives me a way to store my information, communicate and publish information both internally and externally. It gives you a great start.<p></p>
Then I link up my paid domain account with a free Google Account which gives me more tools in the Free area (a little disconnect here).<p></p>
I add in Google <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Reader" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/reader">Reader</a> and Google Bookmarks.<p></p>
I can use IGoogle and Google Gadgets to create an interface that can be used internally and external by using existing or developing widgets.<p></p>
I can share information and access with people internally and externally.<p></p>
I am given a pretty robust communications platform using email, talk, and SMS.<p></p>
I can access most of my information using Android and other mobile tools.<p></p>
I can publish different types of information using Google Docs, Google Sites.<p></p>
I can publish media using Google Video, <a class="zem_slink" title="YouTube" rel="homepage" href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Picasa" rel="homepage" href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>.<p></p>
You are given a business layer for developing custom systems using Google <a class="zem_slink" title="Google App Engine" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>. And also a library of code to work from or store your open source libraries at Google Code.<p></p>
You are given a solid data storage core using <a class="zem_slink" title="GData" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GData">GData</a> at the heart of many of the Google Applications. Most things are accessble via an <a class="zem_slink" title="Application programming interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>.<p></p>
You have social elements with Google <a class="zem_slink" title="Friend Connect" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect">Friend Connect</a>, Google Social Graph, and <a class="zem_slink" title="OpenSocial" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial">OpenSocial</a>.<p></p>
Then you can process payments using Google checkout to make all your money.<p></p>

<!--Session data--><p></p>
<input id="jsProxy" onclick="jsCall();" type="hidden" /> <input id="gwProxy" type="hidden" /><p></p>
There are definitely lots of gaps in there. However you start seeing the vision come together if you squint your eyes.<p></p>
