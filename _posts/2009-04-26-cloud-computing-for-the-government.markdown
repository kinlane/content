title: 'Cloud Computing for the Government'
---
I am conducting my <a href="http://cloud.kinlane.com">cloud computing research</a> and specifically focusing on:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/federal-government">United States Federal Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/state-government">United States State Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/universities">United States University Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/players">Definition and Understanding of Cloud Computing Players</a></li>
</ul>
There is a lot to read and digest around cloud computing. So I am focusing on these areas to keep my research focused and productive.<p></p>
However I am starting to see a lot of posts about foreign government usage and adoption of cloud computing. Although I am hearing a lot of talk in our own federal government usage of cloud computing technologies, I am worried that we will be passed up by other governments, leaving the United States as a lesser player in the cloud computing game.<p></p>
Would be devasting. We need to fund and encourage education, adoption and usage...now!
