title: 'Data Center Preparedness'
---
I have talked before about <a class="zem_slink" title="Data center" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">data centers</a> supporting the cloud and green data center construction strategies. I have heard comments on the amount of data center <a class="zem_slink" title="Infrastructure" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> we have is adequate for the next round of cloud growth.<p></p>
I tend to be an optimist, but I think the next round of cloud adoption is going to be huge.<p></p>
When it matures and we see major <a class="zem_slink" title="Starship Enterprise" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise">Enterprise</a> and Government adoption of the cloud we will see a huge demand for data centers.<p></p>
Also with the success of <a class="zem_slink" title="IPhone OS" rel="homepage" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">IPhone</a> and others following suit such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>, Blackberry, <a class="zem_slink" title="Vodafone" rel="homepage" href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Nokia" rel="homepage" href="http://nokia.com">Nokia</a>, and many others you will see a huge need for cloud data center capacity.<p></p>
I think you are going to see a major rollout of data center providers to support this growth.<p></p>
I think congressional members and other state players need to have their plans in place. How can they court and meet the needs of these data center builders and <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">cloud service</a> providers?<p></p>
Why should data centers be built in their state? What can they offer? Incentives, cheap power, cooling, etc.<p></p>
States need to have their cloud and data center plans in place and this requires a lot of <a class="zem_slink" title="Education" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">education</a> and planning this area. We need to make sure the next round of data center growth is green and happens right here in the United States.<p></p>
I already see a lot of buzz around other countries getting on board, lets not let them court all the data center developers and cloud providers.
