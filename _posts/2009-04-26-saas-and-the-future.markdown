title: 'SaaS and the Future'
---
Was reading this post on, <a href="http://www.ubikwiti.com/blog/?p=576">90% of SaaS companies and Most I.T. Major Players will not exist in present form by recession's end</a>.<p></p>
I really can't speak to how much the <a class="zem_slink" title="Recession" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession">recession</a> and current <a class="zem_slink" title="Financial crisis" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">economic crisis</a> will affect <a class="zem_slink" title="Technology" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Technology">technology</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Infrastructure as a service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service">IaaS</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Platform as a service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">SaaS</a> providers. However I relaly can believe in the consolidation of SaaS providers.<p></p>
I see tremendous opportunities for some of the big players to go around acquiring Software as a Service providers to rapidly build a massive suite of quality services to offer.<p></p>
Seems like a great way to build a great suite of tools and services without having to develop them internally.<p></p>
I think many companies could acquire the best of breed services as well as seed the market with ideas that savvy developers could snatch up, develop and be ripe for <a class="zem_slink" title="Mergers and acquisitions" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions">acquisition</a>.<p></p>
I haven't done any of the math around the costs involved with taking and idea from start to market vs. purchasing an existing software as a service provider.<p></p>
I could envision it would be affordable to let some starving programming do the grunt work, and then just snap them up.<p></p>
Just a random thought!
