title: 'Evolving Our Government'
---
Lately I am very interested in the Government usage of social media and cloud computing (<a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">SaaS</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Infrastructure as a service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service">IaaS</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Platform as a service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a>) . I have been reading and doing a lot of research in this area lately.<p></p>
I came across great post on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">programmableweb</a> today called <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/04/27/an-online-dialogue-to-shape-recoverygov/">An Online Dialogue to Shapre Recovery.gov</a>.<p></p>
Lots of great information, and showcases how the administration is trying open up government data and make things more transparent.<p></p>
There is also lots of information on the stimulus money available to fund the next round of growth of the Internet and Cloud Computing
