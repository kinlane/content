title: 'Too tired to Blog...'

Haven't had much time lately to blog.  Currently getting ready  for the SAP SAPPHIRE event in Orlando.

Our team has been preparing our servers, technology, registration counters, airport registration, and much more for the event.

Orlando is cool, but haven't had much time to explore.  Maybe was the event gets under way we'll have more time.  

Showed up at 9AM today and left about 11PM.

The team is great, I'm enjoying myself.
