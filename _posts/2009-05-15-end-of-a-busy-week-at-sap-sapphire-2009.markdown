title: 'End of a Busy Week at SAP SAPPHIRE 2009'
---
Finished up a very busy week yesterday at the SAP SAPPHIRE 2009 conference in Orlando, FL.<p></p>
Haven't had much time on my hands to do any blogging or much of anything beyond just managing registration at SAPPHIRE.<p></p>
The show was a success. I feel good about it. It was my first on-site with the company and it is our largest event of the year.<p></p>
We had several technology successes including Airport Registration at the Orlando Airport and Self Check-In Kiosks.<p></p>
Both were a huge success.<p></p>
There was a lot more to come out of the conference, but I am still a little too tired to remember it all. I will blog more later.<p></p>
Also I am postponing my trip to Washington DC to get caught up on some work and prepare for the Google IO conference in 2 weeks.
