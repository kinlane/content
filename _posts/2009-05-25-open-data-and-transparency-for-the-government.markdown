title: 'Open Data and Transparency for the Government'
---
I am excited about the recent launch of Data.gov. I am very passionate about what API and open data access can do for companies and belive the same is true about Government.<p></p>
Now that the site is launched....we need some data. Doesn't look like much is available quite yet. I queried all categories and all agencies and got eight results. Its a start.<p></p>
I will be watching on a regular basis to see what data sets show up.<p></p>
Hopefully many more agencies see the value in posting their data online and involving the public at large.
