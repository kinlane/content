title: 'Google IO Wrapup'
---
I am still processing my notes and information from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google I/O" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a> conference in San Francisco last week. I will be making some individual posts on different sessions I attended.<p></p>
I wanted to speak to my overall experience at the conference.<p></p>
I had a little insight behind the scenese because even though I went as an attendee the company I work for WebEvents global handled the registration for the event. So I got to see a littlle of the behind the scense action.<p></p>
As usual I am thoroughly impressed <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a>'s approach. I like their style.<p></p>
They reaffirmed for me that the future of computing is on a mobile platform. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android platform</a> will be a big part of this. They gave away great Android phones to every attendee, very Oprah style.<p></p>
Then they made the announcment of their new Internet changing product Google Wave. It is the first product I've seen launched in a while where you just see that it is a game changer. Rather than it sneaking up on you like <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or something, where you spend a year or two explaining to people what it is before it takes off.<p></p>
I thoroughly enjoyed their approach to cloud application development sessions, enterprise integration sessions and generally networking with all the people there.<p></p>
More to come as I continue processing what happened.
