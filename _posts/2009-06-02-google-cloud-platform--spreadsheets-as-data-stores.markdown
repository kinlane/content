title: 'Google Cloud Platform - Spreadsheets as Data Stores'
---
I attended many great sessions while at <a class="zem_slink" title="Google I/O" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a>. I really started to see the where they are going with using <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Docs" rel="homepage" href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a> as data stores.<p></p>
I have used as data stores for quite a while, but they are really pushing for them to store enterprise data, <a class="zem_slink" title="Application software" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">application</a> data, <a class="zem_slink" title="Website" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">web site</a> data, and much more.<p></p>
Way back in the day when i was doing <a class="zem_slink" title="Non-profit organization" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization">non-profit</a> work I went and conducted a needs assement at a large educational non-profit. To build a specification for developming a new administrative system.<p></p>
Went I first went in I was told there there is a central <a class="zem_slink" title="Database system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_system">database system</a> by the management. After conducting my multi day technoloy needs assessment I found out that the real staff utilized many many <a class="zem_slink" title="Spreadsheet" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet">spreadsheets</a> as data stores to get their work done. They rarely used the central system.<p></p>
I find this to be common across many organizations.<p></p>
This is why I think <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Apps" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> has huge potential for the spreadsheets to be majorly adopted as data stores for the masses in non-profits, business, and enterprises.<p></p>
I'll talk more formerly about this later.
