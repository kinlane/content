title: 'Freemium Hostage Business Model'
---
I am a big fan of the Fremium Business Model. Where you offer a base account that is free to get users in the door. Then you can upsell them on premium features. It just makes sense.<p></p>
I am also a big fan of the Free Trial for web based software as well. I think this is crucial to allow people to test drive your application and see if it will work for them.<p></p>
However nothing makes me more mad then the Free trial that really isn't Free. They make you put in a credit card then start charging you after the trial period.<p></p>
I dub this the Freemium Hostage model.<p></p>
In January I was test driving large file sharing solutions out there for a potential project. I test drove several that seem to meet my needs. I was going with one called <a href="http://www.sharefile.com/">Sharefile, a secure easy file sharing solution</a>. I had to put my credit card in there to test drive....but on the home page it says Try for Free.<p></p>
So shortly after test driving the client changed the project and we weren't going to address again until summer. So I forget about it until May when I am doing my credit card reconciliation and I see a charge for it.<p></p>
And of course I'm in the middle of back to back conferences and too busy to make time to address....so here it is June and I now have 3 months of charges for this service I never used.<p></p>
I log in and cancel the account....in which it quickly asks a reason why....right under "NO Refunds".<p></p>
So now it doesn't matter to me if they have a good tool. There is no way I'm going to use it, because their business model already rubbed me wrong. They are making a business model off offering up something Free, bait and switching and then taking advantage of people forgetting to cancel.<p></p>
That just doesn't fly in this era of Cloud Computing, SaaS, and pay as you go.<p></p>
So my review of <a href="http://www.sharefile.com/">Share File - Secure File Transfer is DO NOT USE THEM</a>. Do not support Freemium Hostage Business Model. Boooooo!!!<p></p>
I may change my tune if they changed their business model.
