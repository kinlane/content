title: 'Social Media Marketers Who Comment on Blog'
---
This is a message to all you <a class="zem_slink" title="Social media" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Social_media">social media</a> marketers who comment on my blog.<p></p>
Thank you so much for your praise of how wonderful I am and how informative my blog is. However if your comment does not add value to my blog or your link is to relevant content I click <a class="zem_slink" title="Spam (food)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28food%29">SPAM</a>.<p></p>
So don't even bother. Why waste your time and energy?<p></p>
If you are not working in the technology, IT, events, web development, social media marketing, online marketing or related industry...get lost.<p></p>
Your wasting your time....I filter all my comments.
