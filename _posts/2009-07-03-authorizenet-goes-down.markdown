title: 'Authorize.net Goes Down'
---
Was just reading a blog post on Techcrunch about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/03/authorizenet-goes-under-e-commerce-vendors-left-hanging/">Authorize.net going down due to a fire in Seattle</a>. Crazy stuff.<p></p>
Seems like they really had everything tight regarding their systems and even the data center they were in. The fire caused the sprinklers to fry the backup generator.<p></p>
Authorize.net is a mission critical 3rd party provider and definitely impacted a lot of businesses financially.<p></p>
Seems like a company with that size and scale would have some sort of DNS2 located at a data center somewhere else in the country? Or have multiple data centers geographically located at key hubs in the United States.<p></p>
Feel bad for all the e-commerce sites that are dependent on Authorize.net for their sales.<p></p>
