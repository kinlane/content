title: 'Quick Look: HTC Hero running Android'
---
Just came across good <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/17/quick-look-htc-hero/">introductory look at the HTC Hero</a> from <a class="zem_slink" title="TechCrunch" rel="homepage" href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a>. I think this is just the beginning of a wave of <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> based mobile phones and webbooks you will see over the next year or two.<p></p>
2009 will be a big year for new mobile phones and webbooks to be released based upon the Android platform. Which I think will make 2010 definitely a big year for <a href="http://www.concentricsky.com/">Android application development</a>.<p></p>
All this platform buzz and Android development buzzed started for me at Google IO this year. Definitely an exciting time for mobile application development.
