title: 'Google Wave Federation Protocol Code / Setup'
---
One of the more mysterious parts of the Google Wave environment is the core operations of wave communications.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>How does the server work?</li>
	<li>How can you develop in-house tools to keep wave communications behind the firewall?</li>
	<li>How are things going to be secured?</li>
</ul>
I have seen lots of talk about Google Gadgets, Robots, Embeds and the client. However the Google Wave Federation Protocol is over the heads of a lot of people.<p></p>
This is where I really think the innovation is going to occur that will ensure business and enterprise adoption of Google Wave. I haven't seen much rubber meeting the road here as I fight to develop my own understanding of the Google Wave Federation Protocol.<p></p>
I was beginning to wonder if Google was keeping this part of the architecture a little more secret, but then Friday they released some <a href="http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-wave-federation-protocol-and.html">open sourced code for Google Wave Federation Protocol</a> from last Mondays API Hackathon. They released two components:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li> Operational Transform (OT) code and the underlying wave model</li>
	<li>Basic client/server prototype that uses the wave protocol</li>
</ol>
I am not a Java developer and will have to rely on partners to evaluate this code and its use. I am hoping other platforms follow suit and would like to see a Python and / or PHP based Google Wave Protocol server deployment.<p></p>
We'll see how this plays out. Its exciting stuff.<p></p>
