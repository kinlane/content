title: 'Mega Dropdown Navigation Tred'
---
I have been seeing a trend in new navigation on top sites out there. I have heard this suggested from friends and colleagues who are graphic designers.<p></p>

Maybe there is another term out there, but for now I am calling it the Mega Dropdown Navigation.<p></p>
I have seen on top sites such as www.npr.org (new redesign), www.whitehouse.gov, and www.nbc.com to name a few.<p></p>
It provides a new way of getting at large volumes of data broken down in separate sections and categories.<p></p>
I am still skeptical regarding its usage, but at first glance I like much more than old school DHTML menus or hefty left hand navigation.<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mega-dropdown/mega2.png" alt="White House" width="307" height="193" align="right" />
Just in the three examples I am giving I see different implementations.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>On Navigation Click - Pops up when you click on main navigation.</li>
	<li>On Mouseover - Pops up when mouseover the navigation.</li>
</ul>
Also how the navigation shows differs. One NBC and the White House it is a navigation window that pops up. The NPR goes a different approach where the graphical look seems to extend displaying a hidden navigation or section.<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mega-dropdown/mega3.png" alt="NBC" width="297" height="192" align="right" />
Seems like you could go a lot further with it and put dropdown and other tools on this layer.<p></p>
I think what really matters with using a navigation like this is how you inter-connect your data within your site allowing users to get between categories and different sections of your site.<p></p>
Just sharing an observation of a trend I'm seeing, we'll see where it goes.
