Just read another post with data backing up the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=808">growth as Google Android</a> as an application development platform. A post from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> called "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/12405">More Developers Start Working on Android Apps</a>" has some good data from <a href="http://www.flurry.com/">Flurry</a> on application platform growth for Iphone, Blackberry, and Android.<p></p>
The post states:<p></p>
<strong><em>Flurry's stats for Android are definitely encouraging, and there can be little doubt that more and more developers are starting to look at Android as an alternative platform - especially since Apple's App Store approval process continues to be a mess.</em></strong><p></p>
Which backs up what I have been saying about the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=808">growth of Google Android as a viable mobile platform</a> in 2009 and 2010.<p></p>
Definitely something to watch if you are considering <a href="http://www.concentricsky.com/">developing an application for Iphone, Android or Blackberry</a>.
