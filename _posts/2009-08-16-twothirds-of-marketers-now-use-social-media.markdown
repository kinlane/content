<strong>I am just gonna paste this article I came across on <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a>, called <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/14/social-media-marketers/">Two-Thirds of Marketers Now Use Social Media</a> because it says it all:</strong><p></p>
Earlier this year, we reported that 63 percent of companies planned to <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/23/social-media-marketing-budgets/">increase their spending on social media</a> in 2009.  Thus, it's not too surprising that a <a href="http://www.ana.net/news/content/1824">recent study</a> from the Association of National Advertisers reveal that 66 percent of marketers have now used social media in some capacity in 2009.<p></p>
Also not surprising, the top platforms being utilized: <span class="blippr-nobr"><a class="blippr-inline-smiley blippr-inline-smiley-05" rel="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336650-Facebook.whtml" href="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336650-Facebook" target="_blank"><span>Facebook</span></a></span> (74%), <a href="http://mashable.com/category/youtube/"></a><span class="blippr-nobr"><a class="blippr-inline-smiley blippr-inline-smiley-05" rel="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336658-YouTube.whtml" href="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336658-YouTube" target="_blank"><span>YouTube</span></a></span> (65%), <a href="http://mashable.com/category/twitter/"></a><span class="blippr-nobr"><a class="blippr-inline-smiley blippr-inline-smiley-07" rel="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336651-Twitter.whtml" href="http://www.blippr.com/apps/336651-Twitter" target="_blank"><span>Twitter</span></a></span> (63%), <span class="blippr-nobr"><a class="blippr-inline-smiley blippr-inline-smiley-05" rel="http://www.blippr.com/apps/337623-LinkedIn.whtml" href="http://www.blippr.com/apps/337623-LinkedIn" target="_blank"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></span> (60%). Combined, this usage represents significant growth from 2007, when the same survey indicated that just 20 percent of marketers were using social media.<p></p>
Although social media marketing is clearly on the rise, it remains a relatively small part of most marketing budgets. ANA reports that the bulk of spending will still go to maintaining a company website, search marketing, and online display ads.<p></p>
That said, social media (including blogs) remains the quickest growing marketing segment, and as we recently reported, it's expected to <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/07/08/social-media-marketing-growth/">grow to a $3.1 billion industry</a> by 2014.  In all, it looks like social media marketing still has a healthy amount of growth in front of it.<p></p>
<strong>It really shows that even though some of this feel that social media marketing is getting mature, it still has some growth ahead of it.</strong>
