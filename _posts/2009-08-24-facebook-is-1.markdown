title: 'Facebook is #1'

Alright, what gives? My Facebook profile just beat out my blog www.kinlane.com for the number #1 search position for "kin lane" at Google.<p></p>
Wondering what in the algorithm would cause that?<p></p>
Is it because there is more activity on my Facebook than my blog?<p></p>
Is it because Facebook has more prominence?<p></p>
Interesting change in my Google search results and profile rankings.
