title: 'Social Network and 3rd Party Profiles'
---
I was just seeing which of my <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</a> profiles show up in my top 10 google search results. I was also maintaining the <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> Page I setup for WebEvents Global.<p></p>
I like the page activity Facebook pages gives you. It also gives your more reporting if you take out ads, regarding their performance.<p></p>
It would be nice if all social networks give you a base set of analytics to show you profile view counts, your profile activity and other tools.
