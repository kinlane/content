title: 'Google Updates Forms with Two New Significant Features'
---
Google added <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/09/add-page-break-and-go-to-page-in-forms.html">two new features into their Google Docs - Forms tool</a>. You can now:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Add Page Breaks - Breaks in your form allow a wizard style or multi-page form.</li>
	<li>Logic Branch - Which allows you to break your form pages up to have different results based upon answers to questions.</li>
</ol>
Both these features continues to push Google Forms out there as a viable survey, registration and form building tool for organizations to use on their web sites and applications.<p></p>
You can also email forms to people. With data access through the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Docs" rel="homepage" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> API it makes it a powerful information gathering and aggregation tool.
