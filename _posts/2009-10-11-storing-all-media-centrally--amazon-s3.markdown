title: 'Storing all Media Centrally @ Amazon S3'
---
People are always talking about putting your faith into the cloud. I am definitely worried about putting all my data online, and think about the repercussions of it.<p></p>
Now that Amazon Web Services have been around a while, my Amazon S3 storage account has become a central utility in my personal and business life. It is the central storage for all personal images, files, and video. I depend on it for business file and backup storage. I store everything from images to server machine images there for future use.<p></p>
Amazon S3 is one thing that has become a constant. As my servers and workstations age I can rely on my Amazon S3 for having a copy of everything. <img class="alignright" title="Amazon Web Services" src="http://kinlane-com-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon_web_services.gif" alt="" width="326" height="127" align="right" /><p></p>
I upload files using Firefox Add-On S3 Organizer, I map a drive using Jungle Disk for my workstations and my servers.<p></p>
As I move some of my personal blogs around I am having trouble managing all the media that goes with them. They are all stored on the local drive. I already backup my wordpress blogs and mysql database nightly and upload to Amazon S3. So I thought I should be storing all my media there as well.<p></p>
Of course there is already an Amazon S3 Wordpress Plugin. Very cool....just trying it out with this blog post.
