title: 'Wordpress Plugin - Booking Calendar'

</div>
I am always impressed with where you can take <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> as a web site management tool. It goes well beyond just being a blogging platform or even a simple <a class="zem_slink" title="Content management system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system</a>.<p></p>
With the Plugin directory a site owner can take it a long way. There are thousands of simple plugins available providing different functionality.<p></p>
However I am coming across more Free + Premium plugins that give you introductory functionality and an upsell for more features.<p></p>
I like this model. I was just checking out <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/booking/">Booking Calendar Wordpress Plugin</a>. It has a Basic and Pro version. I don't have any need for calendaring on my blog, but being in the events industry I see a lot of simple sites that could use this type of functionality.<p></p>
I'm going to install the FREE just to play with and see what it offers.
