title: 'World Time Zone Management'

Our teams have been working on some meeting and event planning systems lately that are deployed for multiple global events spanning many time zones.<p></p>
So having quality time zone information and meeting scheduling accuracy is very important.<p></p>
I have researched and came across several interesting links:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzref.tzc">Time Zone Event Planner - Compare Multiple Time Zones</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://worldtimeengine.com/api/">World Time Engine API</a></li>
	<li><a href="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/">The tz database</a></li>
</ul>
I ended up purchasing the <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/time_zone_guide/">World Time Zone Database Subscription</a> because it provided the best set of data.<p></p>
Except when I purchased I expected a confirmation email or something....I got nothing...just an on-screen receipt saying it will be sent tomorrow. Kind of expected some instant gratification XML in a login w/ email?
