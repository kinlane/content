So you can send <a href="text messages (SMS) using this API">text messages (SMS) using this API</a> and in addition you can also send text messages using email.<p></p>
The service is called <a href="text messages (SMS) using this API">TextMagic Bulk SMS Gateway</a>.<p></p>
They offer a Java, Ruby , PHP, Python, Perl code as part of their SDK to connect.<p></p>
