title: 'Class Wars Online'
---
I have seen a lot of data trying support the class distinction between different users of online applications and services.<p></p>
I've seen the comparison between <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/more_proof_facebook_for_the_rich_myspace_for_the_poor.php">Facebook users being more intelligent and affluent than MySpace Users</a>. I also saw a post on Mashable that <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/10/18/credit-scores-email/trackback/">Gmail users have higher credit scores than Yahoo mail users</a>.<p></p>
<strong><em>I have to wonder....does the data support this or does presenting the data create this? <a href="http://newzar.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/saving-money/"><img class="alignnone" title="Rich and Poort" src="http://newzar.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/rich_poor.jpg?w=300&amp;h=210" alt="" width="300" height="210" align="right" /></a></em></strong><p></p>
Is it just human nature to slice and dice our world by affluence, race, color, religion and all these other lines we can draw within, and then we use as tool for deciding whether someone colors in the lines or not?<p></p>
What value does this kind of data represent? Besides polarizing already painful lines that we should be moving beyond. These lines only cater to peoples ego and feeds the idea that they are elite and further alienates others.<p></p>
As I finished both these articles the other night I also had made a new friend on Facebook and she had this quote on her profile:<p></p>
<strong><em>"We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to mankind." MLK Jr.</em></strong><p></p>
I have moments where I color in the lines perfectly and even highlight the edges of the lines with the color I am using. Other times I scribble all over the page. <strong><em></em></strong><p></p>
I guess if all of you need your lines go ahead and have them, I can use them against you to push the boundaries of what you will accept.<strong><em>
