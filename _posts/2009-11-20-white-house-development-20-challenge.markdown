The <a class="zem_slink" title="White House" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.89767,-77.03655&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=38.89767,-77.03655%20%28White%20House%29&amp;t=h">White House</a> recently announced the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/Development-2-point-0-Challenge">Development 2.0 Challenge</a>, a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/Development-2-point-0-Challenge">Tech Competition for the Developing World</a>.<p></p>
They are attempting to crowd-source international development initiatives and get away from programs being designed by experts and government officials without sufficient input from citizens, social entrepreneurs, or people.<p></p>
They are looking forpeople from around the world to submit ideas for solving various development issues. They look to reach out to non-traditional groups including students, social entrepreneurs, and individuals with great ideas for solving a development problem in every sector, including disaster management, health, agriculture, and education.<p></p>
Definitely exciting to see some more innovation coming from the White House. Crowd sourcing is the ultimate usage of technology for democracy. Although it is kind of socialist too. Hmmmm...
