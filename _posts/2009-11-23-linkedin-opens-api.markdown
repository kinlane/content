title: 'LinkedIn Opens API'
---
<a href="http://64.74.98.87">LinkedIn finally opened up their API</a> to the world. It gives you authentication, profile, and network access to LinkedIn Profiles.<p></p>
It is definitely a step forward. Unfortunately I am looking for access to the events, question and answer, and group access through the API as well.<p></p>
Also I would like access to the LinkedIn application platform too! I guess I want the world, but access to the profiles is a start.<p></p>
LinkedIn seems to be way behind the competition in this area. It is either really a lot of work for them or they are just being very very cautious in their approach.
