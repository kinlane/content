title: 'Better Google Analytics'
---
I have been playing with a new tool that gives you more control over your Google Analytics called <a href="http://www.trakkboard.com/en">Trakkboard</a>. Google Analytics gives you a lot of tools, probably more than you really ever use.<p></p>
However I am always looking for new takes on how to access and absorb all of the data they give you. <a href="http://www.trakkboard.com/en">Trakkboard</a> gives you the opportunity to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>compare data from several Google Analytics accounts with each other.</li>
	<li>follow current developments from your desktop.</li>
	<li>summarize the most important <a class="zem_slink" title="Key performance indicator" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_performance_indicator">key performance indicators</a> on just one dashboard.</li>
</ul>
I will give more data as I play with. I was hoping to get more "dashboard" style tools to be able to give executives and managers access to overview data. We'll see how it goes.
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">
<h1 class="grey"><span class="red">Trakk</span>Board</h1>
</div>
