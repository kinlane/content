title: 'Event Technology'

I am doing a lot of research in applications and tools that are available out there for the event and conference industry.<p></p>
I am always evaluating broad categories of event technology, but recently I am focusing on:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.lilnkedin.com">LinkedIn</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a></li>
</ul>
There are limitless ways you can use these social and 2.0 tools for conferences and events. I have so much research I need to gather and organize I went ahead and lit up a new blog to store and organize.<p></p>
Calling it <a href="http://www.eventsintheclouds.com/">Events in the Clouds</a>. No theme or anything yet, just pure information.
