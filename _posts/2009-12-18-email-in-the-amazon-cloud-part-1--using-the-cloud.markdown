title: 'Email in the Amazon Cloud Part 1 - Using the Cloud'
---
Amazon is a great place to really take care of business when it comes to IT. First order of business at my new job last year was to take care of a really troubling "hostage" situation with their current server co-location contract. My boss said, "move us to the cloud". I had used Amazon Web Services before, I thought I should check out other providers as well. So I toured a handful of cloud providers, but ended up back with Amazon Web Services.<p></p>
They just offered the computing and storage power I needed with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. Plus the opportunity of using more services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">Amazon SimpleDB</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon Cloudfront</a>.<p></p>
So I moved us over. It took me 2 months to migrate from three extremely overloaded servers a platform that we could grow from. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> let me really balance out our load and really get a solid base up and running quickly.<p></p>
Beyond our base need for web, databases, ftp, version control, and web services, we had high needs for volume email and more specifically SMTP services.<p></p>
So I started evaluating how we sent mail and got to work at optimizing this process for <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1098">scaling email for large blasts</a>.
