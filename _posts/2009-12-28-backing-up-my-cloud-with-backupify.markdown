title: 'Backing up my cloud with backupify'
---
I came across a cloud backup tool the other day called <a href="http://www.backupify.com">backupify</a>. It runs in the cloud and backs up your cloud.<p></p>
Very cool.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.backupify.com/">backupify</a> is pretty easy to setup. It acts like most social aggregators like <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">Friendfeed</a>, however it then backs up your data rather than syndicating it or providing a single feed.<p></p>
I authorized backupify to access the following accounts:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Flickr</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Delicious</li>
	<li>Google Docs</li>
	<li>Worpress</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
It offered a few other service back ups. However they were not services I was either using or concerned about.<p></p>
Then I could choose either Weekly or Daily backup settings. As well as email when backups run.<p></p>
Pretty cool tool. It has an archives, history and profile management tools as well. I'll post again in a few days and we'll take a look at what data is available to us.<p></p>
It is a pretty simple little tool. I can see if becoming pretty valuable for companies that depend on cloud services.
