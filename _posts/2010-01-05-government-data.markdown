title: 'Government Data'

<p>I am going through the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/BAM/GRB0911intro.shtml">2009-2011 Governor's Recommended Budget for Oregon</a>. I can get at some pretty good PDF docuemtns with information on budget. Good data in there.</p>
<p>Problem is I can't get it in any digestable format. XML? CSV? Excel? JSON?</p>
<p>Someday all city, state and federal governments will have to publish all of their data via API.</p>
<p>Luckily in Adobe PDF Reader I can just highlight the tabular data, right click and and export to spreadsheet.</p>
