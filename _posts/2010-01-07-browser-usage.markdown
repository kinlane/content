title: 'Browser Usage'
---
I just realized a funny thing.  I use 3 different browsers on a daily basis now.

I use Firefox for my personal sites and web applications.
I use Chrome for my work sites and web applications.
I use IE 8 for watching movies, TV and Media.

I generally have work and personal in separate browsers so I can logged into both Google accounts at the same time.

Then I use IE for media just because if it freezes up and crashes it leaves my work and personal browsers alone.

Funny realization.
