title: 'Oregon State Budget'
---
I was doing my taxes the other day. I thought to myself. Where does all my tax money go. <img title="Oregon State Capital" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/oregon-budget/oregon-capital.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="127" align="right" /><p></p>
For quite a while I thought how nice it would be to be able to tell the government how to spend my money. I would like a multiple choice form showing how I want it spent.<p></p>
Everyone told me it would not happen in my life time. I think it will. We have to start somewhere.<p></p>
I am seeing transparency occuring in governement at all levels, and seeing social tools used more and more in Government.<p></p>
I started playing with a tool that would allow me to publish the Oregon State Budget and then dictate how important each expenditure area is to me personally.<p></p>
I wanted to to <a href="http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/">tell Oregon how to spend my tax money</a>. We'll see.<p></p>
I can see this applied to any Federal, State, Country or any entities budget for that matter. I have Oregon's budget published, maybe I will do the Federal government next.<p></p>

It is still a work in progress.
