I wanted to reintroduce everyone to <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts</a>. If you haven't heard about it, it is a quick and easy way to create chart from data sources.<p></p>
It is so easy to use. I think it is a tool that more people need to hear about and understand how they can easily use to embed charts in web pages, word documents, pdfs, spreadsheets and much more.<p></p>
To create a chart, all you do is pass your data and labels for the data using a URL or web site address:<img class="alignnone" title="Sample Chart" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=t:60,40&amp;chs=250x100&amp;chl=Hello|World" alt="" width="250" height="100" align="right" /><p></p>
<code>http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=t:60,40&amp;chs=250x100&amp;chl=Hello|World</code><p></p>
The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Chart API</a> then returns a .png image representation of your data.<p></p>
You can choose the chart type and size as well as dynamically pass your data to be presented in the chart or graph.<p></p>
I am finding new uses for it everyday to quickly add visuals to blogs, web sites and emails that I do daily. Visuals go a long way.
