title: 'Open Source Government Data Marketplace'
---
Someone needs to create an open source version of <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>.<p></p>
Every city, county and state municipalities need a copy. There needs to be a well written, secure and standards based open source version available.<p></p>
It would be setup identical with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>RAW Data Catalog with XML, CSV, KML, etc data files</li>
	<li>Tool Catalog or Marketplace</li>
	<li>GeoData Catalog</li>
</ul>
It would also give all the links to integrate and share data with other government entities.<p></p>
It would have an FAQ, Share Tools, Blog , etc.<p></p>
It wouldn't be that difficult to develope. Would just need the right specifications and team behind it to make sure it is written securely.
