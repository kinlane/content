title: 'Social Budgets and Contributions'
---
Many projects I do in my spare time are purely for the exercise and learning experience. I have been developing a tool I am calling social budgets.<p></p>
I am very political, but I get frustrated when I don't fully understand what is going on at a state and federal level. I like to have a deep understanding before I take action or even open my mouth.<p></p>
So I wanted to understand where the State of Oregon is spending their money and create a way I can voice my opinion on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> priorities.<p></p>
So I created an <a href="http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/">Oregon Social Budget</a> site. The next day I saw California released their budget, so I wanted to evaluate their budget and created a<a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/"> California Social Budget</a> site.<p></p>
What did I learn?
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>I learned about the ways that Oregon and California track their budget.</li>
	<li>How they spend and prioritize these budgets.</li>
	<li>I learned that even though governments are using the word "transparency", they don't actually make it any easier to get at the data.</li>
	<li>I learned about new agencies and commissions that operate at the state level.</li>
</ul>
It has been fun so far. I am pushing my knowledge of government operations and building a cool little social tool.<p></p>
I want to keep working on the tool and evolve it, so I am looking into other potential uses.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Federal Budget Priorities</li>
	<li>Congressional and Senator Contribution Tool</li>
</ul>
Any other ideas? We'll see how much time I have.
