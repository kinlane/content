title: 'Video in the Cloud'
---
I was looking for an <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1154">open source image gallery solution</a> for a friend the other night. Tonight after reading <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/10/cloud-computing-enterprise/">The Coming Tornado: Cloud in the Enterprise</a>. I got into researching a couple of other areas of open source or cloud tools that I can add to my IT cloud stack.<p></p>
I came across<a href="http://pandastream.com"> Panda</a>, an <a href="http://www.itintheclouds.com/?p=59">open source video sharing application</a>. I was going to install <a href="http://www.plogger.org/">Plogger</a>, the image gallery tool I found the other night, on an Amazon EC2 instance and make an AMI out of it. So I could share it with the community and offer a <a href="http://www.itintheclouds.com/?p=61">cloud based image gallery tool</a>.<p></p>
So tonight when I started to look for an open source video solution I thought I would create an Amazon AMI from this too. However the ingenious folks building Panda have already seen the future. Very nice.<p></p>
Anyways, <a href="http://pandastream.com">Panda</a> is a great addition to my IT cloud stack in the SaaS category.
