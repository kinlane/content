title: 'Where Does My Money Go?'

I found a much more colorful visual of where government spending goes. It is in the UK, but still very cool.<p></p>
They did a much better job visually displaying the data then I did on my <a href="http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/">Oregon</a> or <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/">California</a> State Budgets.<p></p>

Pretty cool visualizations of Government spending. I predict much more to come in 2010.
