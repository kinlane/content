Over the next several months Google Buzz begin rolling out APIs for   developers.  Our plans involve full/read write support for updates   with the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023">Atom   Publishing Protocol</a>, rich activity notification   with <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a>,   delegated authorization with <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>,   federated comments and activities   with <a href="http://www.salmon-protocol.org/">Salmon</a>,   distributed profile and contact information   with <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/faq/">WebFinger</a>, and much, much more.  We invite   developers to join us in these conversations on   the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-buzz-api">Buzz   API Group</a>.
