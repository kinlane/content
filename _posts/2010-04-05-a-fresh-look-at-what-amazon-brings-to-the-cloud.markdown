<img class="alignright" title="Amazon  Web Services" src="http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/logo_aws.gif" alt="" width="164" height="60" />One of the reasons I blog is to provide a focus to my research and  learning. I use this research to help me revisit many of the  technologies that I stay in tune with.

Amazon was one  of the first movers in the Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  arena. They have dominated this space and are providing backbone  services to many of the top Software as a Service (SaaS) and even  Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers.<p></p>
Most of their cloud offerings are available through the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/console/"><strong>Amazon Console</strong></a>,  and all of them through the Application Programming Interface (API) for  full access. Amazon has addressed many of the pain points in developing platforms and software that runs in the clouds. A pretty impressive offering.
