title: 'Rediscovering Zend Framework'
---
I am working with several Google APIs this evening. I am pulling my<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gmail/oauth/code.html"> Gmail Messages using Oauth</a>. In the Google Code samples they use <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>.<p></p>
When I had my web development company I made the transition from ASP to PHP I used the Zend framework as a backbone to my platform. So I am familiar.<p></p>
Looking through the libraries I think its definitely time to rediscover the <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> and save myself some time and energy.
