title: 'Google oAuth Calls'
---
While working with the Google API tonight I registered my primary research and development domain with them so that I could make oAuth calls to Google API.<p></p>
You need to go to: <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains">https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains</a><p></p>
You need to register your application with Google. Using this page, you can identify your web domain(s) . Once you've successfully registered your domain, you will be able to programmatically access Google data on behalf of your users.<p></p>
This new, automated registration process has three steps:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Verify administrator access to the domain.</li>
	<li>Accept terms of service. At this point, your domain is active but not yet registered.</li>
	<li>Set up domain properties and provide authentication certificate.</li>
</ul>
For those of you familiar with oAuth its pretty standard. Just is a little difficult to find within the Google universe.
