title: 'Data Storage in the Clouds'
---
I have been answering a lot of questions on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> lately about where the best place to store data in the clouds. There are a lot of answers to this question.<p></p>
Cloud storage comes in many shapes, sizes, and prices. Business class, personal usage, storage APIs and much more.<p></p>
I store my:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> machine images in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></li>
	<li>Server data, logs and files in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon  S3</a></li>
	<li>Personal workstation back ups in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon  S3</a></li>
	<li>Images on <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, and Zip up originals and upload to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon  S3</a></li>
	<li>Documents (Word, PDF, Spreadsheets) in Google Docs (FREE and Google App)</li>
</ul>
I overwhelmingly use Amazon S3. I get my data there using 3 different methods:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> Backups and Mapped Network Drives</li>
	<li>Firefox <a href="http://www.s3fox.net/">S3 Fox</a> Add-On</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.crossftp.com/">Cross FTP Client</a></li>
</ul>
Jungle disk does most of the heavy lifting. With most of my individual interactions using a mapped drive with <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> and <a href="http://www.s3fox.net/">S3 Fox</a> in Firefox.<p></p>
I don't feel <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon  S3</a> is best storage solution for every person or business. I choose it primarily because it allows me to store data:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>From Automated Back Ups</li>
	<li>Manually</li>
	<li>Programmatically in Web Applications</li>
</ul>
Most importantly because I have control over my data. I've been up there over over 2 years now. I've never lost any data. I pay a low price and I know I own my data.<p></p>
It won't disappear when the start-up goes out of business or is acquired.<p></p>
I keep my business files, taxes, music, photos, videos and much more up there. My data is important, and I will pay to keep it organized in one place in clouds.<p></p>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon  S3</a> has overwhelmingly won over my continued business.
