title: 'OExchange - Sharing Standard'
---
<a href="http://www.oexchange.org/">OExchange</a> is an open protocol for sharing any URL with any service on the web.<p></p>
<strong>The Problem</strong><p></p>
Lots of services accept URL-based content  social networks, news and bookmarking sites, communication tools, long-tail forums, translation and printing utilities  and more appear every day. Why do blogs still show chiclets for only the top few social networks? Why can't users engage with more personal, relevant, dynamically-discovered options? Why are sharing tools still "integrating" with services individually?
<strong>
The Solution</strong><p></p>
<a href="http://www.oexchange.org/">OExchange</a> makes it possible to share any URL-based content with any service on the web. It defines:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>A common way for services to receive content, removing any and all service-specific integration requirements</li>
	<li>A discovery feature so services can publish themselves and their endpoints, making it possible to integrate with services you didn't even know about at development time</li>
	<li>A decentralized, user-centric model for saving preferred services, making sharing more personal</li>
</ul>
It is good to see standards evolve to help direct the social ecosystem we are all building together. Many key players are stepping up behind the <a href="http://www.oexchange.org/">OExchange</a> standard, such as LinkedIn, Digg and Google.
