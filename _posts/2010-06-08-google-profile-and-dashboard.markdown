title: 'Google Profile and Dashboard'
---
I am looking around my Google Account Ecosystem and playing. Since the  addition of Google Buzz I spend more time looking at my profile page.<p></p>
My buzzs' come up more in searches so I tend to stumble on my own  profile page more.<p></p>

I have used iGoogle as my home page since...I  can't remember. Its been years. I have various widgets and tools  exposed on my iGoogle.<p></p>

iGoogle is my home page for quick access to Google Search and a handful  of other tools, primarily I use:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Gmail</li>
	<li>Google Reader</li>
	<li>Google Calendar</li>
	<li>Google Wave</li>
	<li>Weather</li>
	<li>Google Tasks</li>
</ul>
I have a bunch of other ones, but rarely use them. I really see Google  Profile increasingly become a very public profile of myself, and my  iGoogle has long been my private personal and business dashboard to the  Internet.<p></p>
Stay tuned as I play with other combination of Google products to see  what I can come up with.
