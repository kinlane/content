title: 'Amazon S3 File Explorer'
---
Amazon Web Services finally added an <a href="http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341c534853ef0134822ff9b1970c">S3 Bucket explorer to the Amazon Console</a>. I was mentioning last week about how mature the offerings in the AWS console are getting, and how the the whole suite of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1415">Amazon Web Services is ready for use by Small Business</a>. <a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/Console-S3.PNG"><img style="padding: 15px;" title="Amazon Console - S3" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/Console-S3.PNG" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a><p></p>
The Amazon S3 interface is pretty simple, but then again it is simple storage. With this addition you can easily manage your:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Servers and Process Power with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=115">Amazon EC2</a></li>
	<li>Raw Object / File storage (PDF, doc, jpg, gif, png, etc.) with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=243">Amazon S3</a></li>
	<li>International content delivery for PDF, Images, Video, Audio using <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=546">Amazon Cloudfront</a></li>
	<li>Simple and Releational Database Storage with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">Amazon SimpleDB</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a></li>
	<li>Scaling with Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Autoscaling</a></li>
</ul>
All of this is available through the Amazon Console. Amazon is the leader when it come to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and has long been driving cloud applications in the SaaS and PaaS space.<p></p>
I think as the Amazon Console matures you will see more <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1415">small business IT managers and owners adopting Amazon cloud services</a>.
