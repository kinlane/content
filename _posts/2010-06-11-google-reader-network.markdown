I recently removed a couple of aggregated tech news sources from my Google Reader. There are a few sources that I think are going beyond what I find valuable in my tech business world.<p></p>
I am relying on my Google Network of friends to refer common stories from major tech news sources to me. I often found we were reading and sharing the same stuff.<p></p>
I cleaned up some of these common sources and I'm looking to find more RSS subscriptions that come straight from the source. Such as corporate, startup blogs, and University programs.<p></p>
So far I'm pretty hungry. Cleaning out my feeds as they come in every 30 minutes. First time in a while I'm left wanting more.<p></p>
I'm relying on my Google Reader Network, and suggestions from colleagues. Let me know if you have any sources you recommend.
