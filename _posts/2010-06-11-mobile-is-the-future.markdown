title: 'Mobile is the Future'

The future is cloudy and accessed through mobile platforms according to the <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/The-future-of-cloud-computing.aspx">Future of the Internet, Cloud Computing</a> report by the Pew Internet and American Life Project.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Imagining the Internet" src="http://www.elon.edu/predictions/images/pew.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
I agree with most of the findings there, I think it will roll out a little differently than anticipated by most, and take longer.<p></p>
I think many companies are jumping on the Iphone and Android mobile application bandwagon, even before asking themselves if there own web site is mobile ready.<p></p>
Is your web site friendly to mobile web surfers? If I click on a link from an email I get from you, end up at your web site on my Iphone, can I navigate around?<p></p>
I know many of the leading edge clients I work with, mobile browsing is not even on the radar.<p></p>
Mobile computing is the future, start with the basics. Get your web site mobile ready.
