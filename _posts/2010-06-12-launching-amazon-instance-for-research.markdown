title: 'Launching Amazon Instance for Research'
---
I'm launching a new Amazon EC2 instance. Its running Windows + PHP + MySQL. Its a preset up instance AMI I have for harvesting data.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Amazon Web Services" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
Its setup with necessary harvest scripts with all my libraries setup just for pulling RSS, XML, and scraping HTML pages.<p></p>
I'm doing some research about how to grow my Google Reader network based upon users who read and liked other posts that I liked.<p></p>
I'll leave my Amazon EC2 instance up while I'm running some harvest scripts.<p></p>
Next I will cleanup and warehouse the data I pulled.<p></p>
Once I'm done I'll backup MySQL and store at Amazon S3 for next time I"m working on this project.
