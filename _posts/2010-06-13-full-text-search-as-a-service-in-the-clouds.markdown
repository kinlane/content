As the cloud stack keep evolving you see some excellent examples of cloud service providers doing one thing, and doing it well. So you don't have to.<p></p>
I stumbled across <a href="http://www.websolr.com/">websolr</a> today, which is cloud <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/">Software as a Service (SaaS)</a> implementation of the robust <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr search server</a>.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.websolr.com/">websolr</a> is <a href="http://www.websolr.com">full-text search implemented in the clouds</a>. <a href="http://www.websolr.com/">websolr</a> allows you to easily deploy full-text searching for your site or application.<p></p>
In this world of ever growing cloud services you can focus on what you do best and use other great tools such as <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">ZenDesk</a> for support and <a href="http://www.websolr.com/">websolr</a> for full-text search.
