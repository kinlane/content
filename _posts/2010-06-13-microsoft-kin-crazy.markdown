title: 'Microsoft Kin Crazy'
---
I'm getting a little annoyed by Microsoft using my name in their new products. A while back they released their mobile technology and platform targeting the youth, called <a href="http://www.kin.com/">Kin</a>. (taking a pretty sweet domain name)<p></p>
Now today I've read that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/microsofts_project_natal_controller_to_be_called_k.php">Microsoft will be renaming their gaming controller project Natal to Kinect</a>. They haven't talked to me about any of this.<img style="padding: 20px;" title="Kin" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Microsoft-Kin.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
So I'm going to be a spoiler and leak information on their next two projects:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Microsoft Kinetic - An web based green power technology project that is meant to compete with <a href="http://www.google.com/powermeter/about/">Google Powermeter</a>. It measures the electricity generated when Kin users rub their bodies together.</li>
	<li>Microsoft Next of Kin - A social networking notification tool that notifies everyone you that your are dead. (when you die of course)</li>
</ul>
Maybe in the future Microsoft could work with me more on their product launches so I wouldn't have to be such a spoiler.
