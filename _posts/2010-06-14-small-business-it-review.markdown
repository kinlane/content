title: 'Small Business IT Review'
---
I got really busy over April and May and neglected a some of my infrastructure.  I'm doing a thorough review / audit of all my Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="IT Management" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/information-technology/ITmanagement2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
In this era of Cloud Computing my review does not stop at workstations, servers and printers.  All services provided by 3rd party providers are included in my IT plan.<p></p>
I'm a little ahead of the curve because I feel confident in using the cloud more than other IT managers.  So a larger portion of my IT infrastructure exists in the cloud.<p></p>
I treat them all the same.  No matter where my infrastructure lies, my goal is to review, document and make sure it meets my business needs.<p></p>
I use a Wiki to track my IT infrastructure, after I go through and do my review I will publish a short list of the different areas of my "cloud" IT Infrastructure.
