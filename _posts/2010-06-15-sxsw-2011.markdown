One event I am looking forward to is the <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">SXSW 2011 conference</a>. <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com">Audrey</a> and I are planning way ahead so that we can attend the Music and Interactive parts of the event.<img style="padding: 25px;" title="SXWS" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events-in-the-clouds/sxsw.jpg" alt="" width="250&quot;" align="right" /><p></p>
I am very excited about the potential lineup for both tech and music. What also gets me going is the way they begin the Call for Papers process. They always crowd-source their panel selection using their <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">PanelPicker</a>.<p></p>
I really feel this type of crowd-sourced approach to building an event is critical for building a loyal fan-base of attendees.<p></p>
Involving your audience in the beginning and through every stage of the event planning, preparation, execution and post event wrap up is just smart event management in this digital / social era.
