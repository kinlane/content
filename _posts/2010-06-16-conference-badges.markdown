title: 'Conference Badges'

I see a lot of conference badges. <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">WebEvents Global</a> specializes in print on demand badges that make the conference check-in experience a breeze. <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Google I/O" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/3574278779_e26a7c1f3d.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
I just finished reading a blot post about <a href="http://www.graphpaper.com/2010/06-11_a-book-on-a-hook">Book on a Hook</a>, a badge from<a href="http://www.thewebandbeyond.nl/2010/website/"> The Web and Beyond 2010</a> event, held in Amsterdam.<p></p>
They showcase badge being a useful as book that the attendee can actually get value out of, beyond just identification.<p></p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/">Google I/O</a> created a very informative and entertaining booklet for their 2009 event.<p></p>
I'm not 100% sold on the usefulness of your badge being a book, but I can how for some events it might work well.<p></p>
I've brainstormed with various people on what makes the perfect event badge, from a high tech RFID card to giving every attendee an IPod Touch for use as a badge.<p></p>
I would like to hear other innovative ideas for badges from attendees and event managers.
