I was reading <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/link/the-chaos-of-byow-bring-your-own-wi-fi?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CloudAve+%28CloudAve%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">The Chaos of BYOW (Bring Your Own Wi-F</a>i) on Cloud Ave yesterday. Several topics I've been talking about come to mind:<img style="padding: 15px;" title="Broadband Internet" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/broadband_pipe.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

	<li>Bottleneck In Cloud Computing Adoption - I've read several posts on this, but have not written one my self. Slow connections will prevent cloud computing adoption.</li>

Internet connectivity is definitely one of the biggest problems we face in delivering conferences, events and cloud computing services.<p></p>
I work to deliver technology for some of the larger events in North America (SAP Sapphire, Google I/O) and I acknowledge this is big problem.<p></p>
I spend a huge amount of time to provide redundant systems to our registration counters at conference centers, airports and hotels.<p></p>
I see speakers and presenters have their sessions fail because of poor Internet connections.<p></p>
These are technology conferences put on by technology leaders.

There are so many issues to discuss on this topic. More to come.
