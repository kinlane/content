<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 20px;" title="Sencha" src="http://www.sencha.com/assets/images/logo-sencha-sm.png" alt="" width="120" height="50" align="right" />The <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/tag/html5/">ExtJS team is really excited about HTML 5</a>. They see HTML 5 as the future. I definitely agree. <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/js/">Ext JS</a>, <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a>, and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaÃ«l</a> are combining into a new entity called <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/06/14/ext-js-jqtouch-raphael-sencha/">Sencha</a>.<p></p>
I have used <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/js/">Ext JS</a> for several web applications and internal adminstration systems. It is one of my favorite JavaScript frameworks that I keep coming back to.<p></p>
I'm excited to see them fully embracing HTML5. One thing I really enjoy about <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/js/">Ext JS</a> is that I don't have to think about the presentation layer much. They just deliver.<p></p>
They have been showcasing their support for HTML 5 also in a flurry of blog posts:

</ul>
Then finally with the release of <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/06/17/introducing-sencha-touch-html5-framework-for-mobile/">Sencha Touch, an HTML5 Framework for Mobile</a>. As they state:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Sencha Touch is the world's first app framework built specifically to  leverage HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for the highest level of power,  flexibility, and optimization.</strong></em>
The initial beta supports IPhone and Android and delivers enhanced touch effects and data request using Ajax, JSONp, or YQL and takes advantage of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/html5-web-storage/">HTML5 Local Storage</a>.<p></p>
Exciting to see not only HTML5 beings upported, but a mobile application framework. I will definitely be watching <a href="http://www.sencha.com">Sencha</a> alongside my other HTML 5 research.
