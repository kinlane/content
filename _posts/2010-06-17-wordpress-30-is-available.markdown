<a href="http://wordpress.org/"><img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Wordpress" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />Wordpress</a> launched their <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/">Version 3.0 of the popular blogging and content management platform</a> today. I'm a big fan and user of Wordpress, so I follow their blog.<p></p>
Some of the features that are notable are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>New default theme called Twenty Ten</li>
	<li>Theme developer API for implementing backgrounds, headers, shortlinks, menus, post types, and taxonomies</li>
	<li>Multi-site management capability</li>
	<li>Ability to set the admin user name and password during installation</li>
	<li><a title="Embeds" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">oEmbed</a> support</li>
	<li>Order link categories by name, not count, on Add New/Edit Link page</li>
</ul>
And much more, you can view a complete list at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0" target="_blank">Version 3.0 Codex</a>. I am going to install it on a couple of my R&amp;D blogs where I just try out new templates, features, and play around with custom Wordpress development.<p></p>
I always appreciate the Wordpress updates but feel the magic is really in the developer ecosystem and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">Wordpress Plugins</a>.
