<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 20ppx;" title="Google Apps Multi Domain" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JPTTyK3AMOQ/TCFx1eIJXmI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/SB-QTcN-mDk/Picture+9.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Gooogle has opened upon support for companies to use <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/06/introducing-multi-domain-support-in.html">multiple domains when setting up their Google Apps</a>. The Google Apps control panel now allows administrators to manage multiple domains and assign to specific resources such as email, docs, and Google Sites.<p></p>
I was always just setting up separate Google Apps accounts for each domain, but now I can manage from a single Google Apps account.<p></p>
Multi-Domain support is available now to Premier and Education edition users at  no additional charge.
