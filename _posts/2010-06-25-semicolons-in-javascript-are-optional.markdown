I have never found a conversation about this, I just stumbled across one and found it interesting.<p></p>
Some of the points the author makes about why you should use semicolons are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Spec is cryptic and JavaScript implementations differ</li>
	<li>You can't minify JavaScript code without semicolons</li>
	<li>It's good coding style</li>
	<li>Semicolon insertion bites back in return statements</li>
</ul>
I am pretty obsessive about using semi-colons in my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a>. It just makes it neat and organized in my opinion. Also keeps me in sync with my PHP programming as well.
