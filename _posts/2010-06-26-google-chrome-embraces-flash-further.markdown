title: 'Google Chrome Embraces Flash Further'

<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Google Chrome" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google releasde<a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/06/stable-channel-update_24.html"> Google Chrome 5.0.375.86</a> on Thursday which includes <em><strong>integrated flash player being enabled by default</strong></em>. Interesting positioning by Google in the Flash v HTML5 battle.<p></p>
Google Chrome is a leader in embracing <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/">HTML5 standards</a> in their browser.<p></p>
Now they are also further embracing Flash by allowing default integration and updates within Chrome. I think this is a wise move to encourage widespread adoption of <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrom</a>e as default browser.
