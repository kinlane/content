<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Google Apps" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/googleapps.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />I was just reading a great <a href="http://www.attentionmax.com/blog/2010/06/moving-your-office-into-the-cloud-2.php" target="_blank">testimonial of moving your business to Google Apps</a>. I use <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-apps-google/">Google Apps</a> as a starting point for all my domains, right after purchasing the domain.<p></p>
Reasons for moving your business to the Google Apps Cloud:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>All Your Data is Backed Up</li>
	<li>Share Your Documents</li>
	<li>Share Your Calendar</li>
	<li>Increased Efficiency</li>
	<li>Reduce SPAM</li>
	<li>Real-Time Web Site Integration</li>
	<li>Search</li>
	<li>Easy administration and low cost</li>
	<li>Accessible anywhere</li>
</ul>
There are many ways to improve Google Apps, but it is a great start for your virtual office on the Internet. It is a critical part of me doing business on the Internet.
