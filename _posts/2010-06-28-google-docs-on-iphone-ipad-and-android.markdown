<a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/06/google-docs-viewer-on-mobile-browsers.html" target="_blank">Google released a  mobile version of the Google Docs viewer</a> for Android, iPhone and iPad today. You can now view PDFs, .ppt, .doc and .docx files that are uploaded to your  documents list, without needing to download the file.<p></p>
I'm viewing more and more office documents on my Iphone and IPad these days. Since I'm exclusively using Google Docs as my office suite, this is a pretty big deal.<p></p>
You can try it out by going to <strong>docs.google.com</strong> on your iPad or iPhone or Android-powered device and select any document  in these formats that you've previously uploaded
