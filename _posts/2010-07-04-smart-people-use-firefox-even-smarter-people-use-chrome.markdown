title: 'Smart People Use Firefox, Even Smarter People Use Chrome'
---
I have been monitoring the traffic to several major technology blogs lately. This research is based upon specific domains with specific brand associate with them:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a></li>
<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="ReadWriteWeb" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/tech-blogs/ReadWriteWeb.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
	<li><a href="http://readwriteweb.com/" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gigaom.com/" target="_blank">GigaOm</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://venturebeat.com/" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a></li>
</ul>
I have been evaluating their "popularity" via via several top tech news aggregation sites and social bookmarking tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/discover/activity/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="StumbleUpon" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/social-bookmarking/stumbleupon.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></li>
	<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">DZone</a></li>
</ul>
As well as traffic and searches at:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ayhoo.com">Yahoo</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.live.com">Windows Live</a></li>
</ul>
While evaluating specific tag cloud patterns, specific technology, scientific, and industry topics. I have seen one major pattern.<p></p>
The mainstream user, uses Internet Explorer, smart people use Firefox, and the real technology leadership uses Google Chrome.<p></p>
<strong>UPDATE: </strong> Thanks for the comments on and offline guys. I am doing this research, but this article was actually a test in creation of titles for tech blog posts in the tech industry. I was comparing a series of posts with different titles containing a mix emotional triggers and technology triggers. Its not scientific but generally I proved that tech readers respond better to more tech with a little emotion vs. mostly emotional. It was true, an overwhelmingly large group of tech bloggers are using Firefox and Chrome, but in no way can I extract intelligence based upon this. Thanks for bearing with my slightly stupid post.
