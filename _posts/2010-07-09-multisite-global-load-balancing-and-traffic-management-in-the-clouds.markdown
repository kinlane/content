<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Zeus Software" src="http://www.zeus.com/assets/img/logo.gif" alt="" width="156" height="50" align="right" />I was just reviewing the cloud tools offered by <a href="http://www.zeus.com/" target="_blank">Zeus</a>. I was researching <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/global-server-load-balancing/">Global server Load Balancing (Cloud Balancing)</a> software yesterday and they were on my list. Unfortunately I used an image from their software and neglected to mention them in my post. I just spent the last couple hours reviewing their tools and 3 specific products stand out:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/multi-site-manager/index.html" target="_blank">Multi-Site Manager</a> - Tools for managing applications that span multiple, geographically distributed, data-centers and cloud providers.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/global-load-balancer/index.html" target="_blank">Global Load Balancer</a> - DNS solutions for managing traffic on geographic locations and data center performance and availability.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/traffic-manager/index.html" target="_blank">Traffic Manager</a> - Manage your application traffic across distributed locations.</li>
</ul>
These are the products they offer that fall under my "cloud application" label. They also offer firewall, load balancers, and web servers. They have locations in:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Cambridge, UK</li>
	<li>San Mateo, CA US</li>
	<li>Rome, Italy</li>
</ul>
Interesting set of products. I'm working through their case studies and white papers to learn more. I just wanted to review their company and core products, and post to my<a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/players/zeus" target="_blank"> cloud computing service provider wiki</a>.
