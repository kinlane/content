<img style="padding: 15px;" title="Schooner Information Technology" src="http://info.northscale.com/rs/northscale/images/ns-logo.gif" alt="" align="right" />After spending some time  last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/" target="_blank">OSCON - Open  Source Convention</a> I noticed a pattern:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There  is an <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/open-source-database-explosion/">explosion in database innovation</a> right now</strong>
I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are  exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. In addition to not listing <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/oscon-database-explosion-part-2/">Schooner Information Technology</a>, I left out the elastic data solution provider:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.northscale.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Northscale</strong></a>
They provide a couple key tools to assist you in managing your elastic data:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://info.northscale.com/membase-beta-download.html" target="_blank">NorthScale Membase Server</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://info.northscale.com/Memcached.html" target="_blank">NorthScale Memcached Server</a></li>
</ul>
Their products are based upon the <a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">memcached</a> and <a href="http://www.membase.org/" target="_blank">membase</a> open source technologies. Their servers are designed to work with existing relational database technology and expertise, and incrementally evolve toward a scale-out data architecture for use by web applications.<p></p>
They provide a <a href="http://info.northscale.com/Devkit.html" target="_blank">developer kit</a> to get you going.
