<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="HTML 5" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/html5.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Deeper and deeper I dive into HTML 5. The WebSocket API allows bidirectional   communications with a server. Think of this one as how you wish AJAX would have been. Not only do you have <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/html-5-server-sent-events/">Server-Sent Events with HTML 5</a>, you can actually have multi-directional communication with any web server.<p></p>
This really opens up the possibilities of making web applications more real-time.<p></p>
You can make your HTML 5 web application communicate, collaborate and receive updates in real-time through web sockets and server-sent events. Definitely a big step in the evolution of web applications.
