title: 'From Note Taking to Remembering Things'

<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 5px;" title="Evernote" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/evernote.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />I'm always working to clean up my platform and better use tools already in my toolbox. I have been using Google Notebook for quite a few years now. I have a lot of information in there, good and bad. Google discontinued Notebook quite a while ago, so I stopped using it. I kind of quit taking notes all together.<p></p>
I have had an <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> account for a while, but don't fully use it. Audrey's religious use of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> has motivated me to use it more. I use the:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Evernote Web Application</li>
	<li>Evernote IPhone Application</li>
	<li>Evernote Desktop Application</li>
</ul>
Tonight I finished importing my Google Notebooks into my Evernote account. I am spending some time organizing my notebooks and get back into the groove.<p></p>
I am permanently turning off my Google Notebook and start using Evernote as a daily part of my platform. I will evolve from note taking to actually remembering things with <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>.
