<a href="http://www.dmtf.org/home" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Distributed Management Task Force" src="http://www.dmtf.org/images/headermain/logo_dmtf.gif" alt="" width="128" height="43" align="right" />Distributed Management Task Force</a> (DMTF) announced the availability of the final two documents produced by its Open Cloud Standards Incubator, which is working to establish a <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/about/cloud-incubator" target="_blank">strategy for cloud standards development</a>. The documents: are
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP-IS0103_1.0.0.pdf" target="_blank">Use Cases and Interactions for Managing Clouds</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP-IS0102_1.0.0.pdf" target="_blank">Architecture for Managing Clouds</a></li>
</ul>
These two documents will be the foundation for DMTF's ongoing cloud standards work. Curious to see where the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> plugs into this vision, there are a lot of players to keep track of in the cloud computing standards and open source game.
