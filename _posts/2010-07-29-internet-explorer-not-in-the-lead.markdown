title: 'Internet Explorer NOT in the Lead'
---
Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Firefox - 40.55%</li>
	<li>Chrome - 30.86%</li>
	<li>Safari - 11.90%</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer - 11.19%</li>
</ul>
Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!
