title: 'Management as a Service (MaaS)'
---
I have been reviewing as many Cloud Service providers as I can get my hands on. I am building a database right now of them and their products, locations, and types of providers. I am breaking them into the following types:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/">Software as a Service (SaaS)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/platform-as-a-service-paas/">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas/">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/open-source/">Open Source</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/enterpise-20/">Enterprise</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Education</a></li>
	<li>Government</li>
</ul>
Cloud service providers usually fit neatly into one or many of those categorizations without a problem. Except for one group; the growing number of cloud management software providers.<p></p>
There are some that have their own data centers or platforms so they easily fit into a category. However there are many service providers that purely provide a cloud management set of tools that work with one provider (Amazon) or several providers, and they offer no infrastructure or platform. They are a software, but not the end user Software as a Service (SaaS) we are used to.<p></p>
I have gone back and forth on this one, feeling they need their own categorization. Then no....they are just a IaaS provider, or wait no Paas, wait no...SaaS.<p></p>
I even discussed this with Audrey and she was intrigued enough to ask RWW readers if <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/08/weekly-poll-are-the-3-common-a.php" target="_blank">the 3 Common Acronyms for Cloud Services Sufficient? </a><p></p>
I am now dubbing cloud management software as Management as a Service (MaaS).
