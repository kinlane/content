title: 'A Programmers Need for an Application Programming Interface (API)'
---
I have a "hobby" harvesting project going on right now. I'm am harvesting several thousand web pages from various locations on a certain topic.<p></p>
I'm not really interested in the content itself, but the top keywords that are used in the content. I pulled the page and extracted the body content that I am interested in analyzing.<p></p>
I then want to pull a list of the top keywords and key phrases used in the page.<p></p>
So I am faced with next steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Spend time researching algorithms for parsing text and looking for words</li>
	<li>Write my own scripts for identifying key words and key phrases (harder than you think)</li>
	<li>Evolve and continue scripts to make more intelligent over time</li>
</ol>
<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 25px;" title="AlchemyAPI" src="http://www.alchemyapi.com/images/alchemyAPI.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="57" align="right" />There is a lot of time and money investment there. Easy to give up on my project at this point.<p></p>
I start looking for existing tools or APIs that would accomplish this. I came across a great <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">tag, keyword, and key phrase intelligence API</a> called <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">AlchemyAPI</a>.<p></p>
They have a great API that takes content, and returns an intelligent set of tags. Now I am one more step closer to being able to <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/08/meaningful-key-phrases-and-tag-sets/" target="_blank">extract meaningful key phrases and tag sets</a>.<p></p>
It is also a great example of how good Application Programming Interface (API) can assist developers in delivering projects.
