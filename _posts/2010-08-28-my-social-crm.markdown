<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Gist" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Gist.PNG" alt="" width="165" height="79" align="right" />I have successfully integrated <a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">social CRM service</a> <a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> into <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/platform/" target="_self">my platform</a>. I have bee using it on a daily basis for about a month now.<p></p>
<a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> allows me to integrate my:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Personal Gmail account and Google Apps Gmail</li>
	<li>Personal Google Contacts and Google Apps Contacts</li>
	<li>Google Calendar</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> then gives me a robust, yet intuitive dashboard to manage people and companies I interact with on a daily basis.<p></p>
I can set the importance of each contact and view social streams, blog posts, emails, and events for all my contacts.<p></p>
<a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> gives me all these great tools for managing my CRM as well as bringing in tons of social and other contact related data.<p></p>
Only thing I don't like is that I really don't have a public facing job at the moment, so my contacts list is very stagnant. That is not really <a href="http://gist.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a>s fault though.
