I"m evaluating their potential for integration into applications.<p></p>
As I'm going through I"m also evaluating how they deliver their API community.<p></p>
I was checking out the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/developers" target="_blank">Scribd API</a> tonight, and I like their delivery. Its pretty straightforward.<p></p>
It has the following API building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Overview</li>
	<li>Sign Up for an API Account</li>
	<li>API Tutorials</li>
	<li>Client Libraries</li>
	<li>User Authentication Overview</li>
	<li>Usage Limits</li>
	<li>Javascript API</li>
	<li>Mobile and E-Reader API and SDK</li>
	<li>Enterprise SDK</li>
	<li>Help / Support</li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
</ul>
They make it easy to sign up for an API account by providing links in navigation and on home page.<p></p>
They provide client libraries in these programming language:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Ruby</li>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>C# / .NET</li>
	<li>ActionScript 3.0</li>
	<li>Python</li>
</ul>
They just make it easy to get up and going by providing the necessary information and tools.<p></p>
Its a good example to follow when deploying an API.
