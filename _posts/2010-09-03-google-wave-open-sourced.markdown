title: 'Google Wave Open Sourced'
---
I was happy to see the announcement by<a href="http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2010/09/wave-open-source-next-steps-wave-in-box.html" target="_blank"> Google, that they were open sourcing more of the Google Wave platform</a>.<p></p>
I was at the keynote speech where they released Google Wave, and I really believed in the potential of it as a platform.<p></p>
The code they released adds more features and delivers a more complete "Wave in a Box" solution.<p></p>
This project will include:<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Google Wave" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-wave-splash.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>An application bundle including a server and web client supporting real-time collaboration using the same structured conversations as the Google Wave system</li>
	<li>A fast and fully-featured wave panel in the web client with complete support for threaded conversations</li>
	<li>A persistent wave store and search implementation for the server (building on contributed patches to implement a MongoDB store)</li>
	<li>Refinements to the client-server protocols</li>
	<li>Gadget, robot and data API support</li>
	<li>Support for importing wave data from wave.google.com</li>
	<li>The ability to federate across other Wave in a Box instances, with some additional configuration</li>
</ul>
Although it doesn't have all the features currently available in the current Google Wave implementation it rounds out the open source offering and makes it a complete platform that is usable.<p></p>
Some of the best features Google has kept for themselves, but maybe the core technology can have a life of its own outside of Google. I think you will see new incarnations of Google Wave showing up as the core of collaboration and communication platforms for years to come.
