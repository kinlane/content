title: 'Rogue API Development'
---
Application Programming Interfaces (API) are a necessity in today's fast paced business community. An API can encourage mobile application, web application, and desktop development by your most passionate users, partners and the public.<p></p>
Even with all this value many businesses don't have time or resources to dedicate to developing, marketing and managing an API.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Hacker News API" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/rroller.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
If you are fortunate enough to have a passionate user base and / or offer a extremely valuable tool, you may generate the attention of rogue API developers.<p></p>
Recently an innovate hacker <a href="http://ronnieroller.com/" target="_blank">Ronnie Roller</a> developed an unofficial <a href="http://api.ihackernews.com/" target="_blank">API for Hacker News</a>. The popular tech news site hadn't launched their own API and apparently Ronnie saw the value in developing himself.<p></p>
This is a great example of someone outside of a company developing what I would call a rogue API that extends the value of a company and its technology so much that it can gain the attention of the company and be officially endorsed, as Paul Graham did with Ronnie's <a href="http://api.ihackernews.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News API</a>.<p></p>
I think you will see more rogue APIs being developed in the future.
