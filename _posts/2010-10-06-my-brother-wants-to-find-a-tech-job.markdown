title: 'My Brother Wants to Find a Tech Job'
---
My little brother Michael is looking for a job in the tech industry.  He asked if he could send his resume my way.  I said sure.<p></p>
I opened his resume and scanned it as I would any other potential hire.  It read:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>I'm very excited about technology</li>
	<li>I have computer science degree</li>
	<li>I worked at my school</li>
	<li>I worked at Circuit City</li>
	<li>I work at a small dev shop in my home town.</li>
</ul>
Then I went to Google like I do for any other potential hire.  Googled his name, and nothing....<p></p>
Nothing that demonstrates the claims in his resume:
<blockquote><em>"I am very excited about the new technological innovations in the computer science field"</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>"I strive to expand my knowledge in a wide variety of topics, and I enjoy learning about new innovative technologies."</em></blockquote>
Now I know my brother and he is a very sharp guy.  Good genes.  :) I know he applied himself in school and he is extremely detailed oriented.<p></p>
After the first batch of us siblings, my mom who was a school teacher decided to home school the second batch of kids.  I think her statement was, I'm not going to let the public schools fuck these kids up like you guys were!.  Thanks mom.<p></p>
So him and my other 2 sisters were home schooled, after which he immediately attended Southern Oregon University and got his degree.<p></p>
Its not his fault he doesn't have the experience to identify what he needs to stand out.  He's a typical geek and focused on writing good code.  I'll see if I can help him a little more.<p></p>
More blog posts to come, with suggestions of how my brother can find a tech job.<p></p>
