title: 'My Brother Wants to Find a Tech Job - Get a Blog'
---
The other day I talked about <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/10/my-brother-wants-to-find-a-tech-job/" target="_blank">my brother Michael was looking for a tech job</a>. He's a .NET programmer with a Computer Science degree, and a working currently.<p></p>
I told him I would give him advice on how to stand out and get the job he is looking for. I took a look at his resume, then put it down and Googled his name. I just didn't see what I was looking to demonstrate that he was active and passionate about the the tech industry.

I am writing a series of blog posts giving him advice.<p></p>
My first recommednation to ANY professional looking to evolve their career is, get a blog. I don't care if you a writer, just do it. My blog is the best tool in my professional development tool box.<p></p>
I recommend Wordpress because you can either download and install on server or use Wordpress.com and they'll host for you.<p></p>
Either way, get your own domain. Go to www.GoDaddy.com and purchase. Try to make it your name, or something relevant to who you are.<p></p>
Then go to Google Apps and register for the standard version, and setup email, calendaring, and documents for domain.<p></p>
You are now ready for business. You have your own personal domain, blog and email.<p></p>
Use your blog for personal development. You are not blogging for other people. You are blogging about projects that are important to you and your development.<p></p>
Write about everything you do (well almost), keep it professional. Your blog will demonstrate that you are learning in real-time without making hollow claims on your resume. It blog should show a professional, yet human side of you.<p></p>
Start blogging today.
