title: 'Instagram - Doing One Thing Well'

<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I have talked in the past about <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2009/03/one-thing-well-crm-sync-tool/">doing one thing and doing it well</a> in the technology space.  A mistake I've made many times, and other developers make is trying to do too much when building applications.<p></p>
You build a system and try to please everyone, by including lots of features, tools, integrations and support many platforms.  I always tell myself, sllow it down!  Focus on one thing and do it really well.<p></p>
I just finished meeting the founder of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8#">Instagram</a> and listening to the story behind the building, and the recent launch of their IPhone based photo application.  Throughout developed they focused on:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Solving a problem by making an easy to use app that makes taking photos fun!</li>
	<li>Providing tools to share your photos easily to the social networks you already are on</li>
	<li>Doing this fast, speed is critical</li>
</ol>
He noted their web site is very incomplete and lacking in a lot of features, and they have received a lot of requests for the IPhone app to do more.<p></p>
As it stands their application is intuitive, you don't have to ask what it does.  Its pretty clear.  You take photos, apply filters and share.  Once you add a bunch more features you can lose the simplicity.<p></p>
He noted they have had a lot of international adoption because of the lack of words and simplistic features.  Pictures and Social Sharing are Universal.<p></p>
It was very interesting to listen to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8#">Instagram</a> story, and really re-enforced my belief in doing one thing and doing it well when building mobile and web applications.
