Google introduced <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/10/automating-business-processes-in-google.html" target="_blank">scripting for Google Sites</a> today.  <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/index.html" target="_blank">Google Apps Script</a> uses JavaScript to allow automation across Google products and interaction with 3rd party services.<p></p>
Google Apps Scripts allow you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Automate repetitive business processes</li>
	<li>Integrate 3rd party services within Google Apps</li>
	<li>Create custom spreadsheet functions</li>
	<li>Build and collect user inputs</li>
</ul>

With Google Apps Scripts you can interact with Google Base, Calendar, Contacts, Document, Finance, Language,  Mail, Maps, Spreadsheets, and now Google Sites.<p></p>
In addition to accessing Google Products they provide many tools for working with UI, SOAP, XML and other helpful utilities.<p></p>
Google Sites moves beyond a simple wiki with the addition of Google Apps Scripting.  It now is more of an application platform allowing integration with other Google products and 3rd party services.
