title: 'Sencha Animator is an Alternative to Flash'
---
<a href="http://www.sencha.com" target="_blank">Sencha</a> just released a new GUI desktop application that enables designers to create rich media animations for HTML5 capable browsers.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/animator/download.php" target="_blank">Sencha Animator</a> allows you to put objects such as text, shapes and images on to re-sizable areas and you can move, scale, skew and rotate objects in 2D or 3D and
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Sencha/sencha-animator" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
Since Sencha Animator generates pure CSS3 its output is customizable, allowing you to add and modify the CSS3 code without hand writing thousands of lines of CSS.<p></p>
Though it doesn't replace all uses of Flash, it can replace several key areas including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Web Animations</li>
	<li>Advertisements</li>
	<li>Splash Screens</li>
	<li>General Web Content</li>
</ul>
Since <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/animator/download.php" target="_blank">Sencha Animator</a> outputs HTML5 / CSS3, it works on major mobile platforms include <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>, and Blackberry OS6.<p></p>
Its just a preview now, and when released they say it will be priced in the "low hundreds of dollars".  We'll have to keep an eye on it.<p></p>
