title: 'My Mimeo Marketplace - Creating a Online Print Store'
---
As I said in my last post <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/10/my-mimeo-future-of-technology-and-printing/">My Mimeo - Future of Technology and Printing,</a> I am starting my new career as the Mimeo API Evangelst.  And before I can even talk about the API I really have to talk about the core products that the API gives you access to.<p></p>
I talked about <a href="http://my.mimeo.com">My Mimeo</a> and how you can build documents online and order them through your My Mimeo account.  It gets even better.

You can also launch a marketplace with the documents you've built in your My Mimeo publishing account.  You can build bound documents, binders, booklets, flyers, brochures, posters, and then you can publish them to a marketplace for others to buy.<p></p>
You can make your marketplace public, invite only or completely private.   You can also allow other My Mimeo account holders to publish their documents to your marketplace.<p></p>
Think about it.  The ideas are endless.  You could build:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Photo Gallery</strong> - A photo gallery where people can buy different size prints of your photos.</li>
	<li><strong>Art Gallery</strong> - An art gallery where you can sell yours, or other people art online.</li>
	<li><strong>Poster Shop</strong> -  You could sell a selection of your custom posters in many different sizes and even have them matted!</li>
	<li><strong>Greeting Card Store</strong> - You could custom make greeting cards and sell them to the public.</li>
</ul>
The ideas are endless.  I've only begun thinking about the different ways that the My Mimeo Marketplace could be used to sell printed products.<p></p>
I haven't even begun talking about the API yet, I am still talking about different ways to use the core Mimeo Print &amp; Publishing products.
