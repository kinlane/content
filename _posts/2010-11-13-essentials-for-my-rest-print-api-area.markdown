title: 'Essentials for My REST Print API Area'
---
I have established the phase one for my Mimeo Connect REST Print API.  I need just the essentials to get the API up and running.<p></p>
I am focusing on providing just the following API building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Dashboard</strong> - Basic API area dashboard with essential links and information.</li>
	<li><strong>Registration</strong> - Allow developers to register with the live and sandbox Mimeo environments.</li>
	<li><strong>Account Management </strong>- Allow developers to manage the details of their accounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Overview</strong> - Overview of the Mimeo web tools and REST Print API.</li>
	<li><strong>Getting Started </strong>- A getting started guide providing developers with exactly what they need to get going.</li>
	<li><strong>REST API Documentation</strong> - General API document for all API services and end points.</li>
	<li><strong>JS / JQuery Examples</strong> - Simple JavaScript samples using the JQuery library.</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong><strong>HP Samples </strong>- Simple PHP samples using the PEAR library.</li>
	<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - Developer sandbox for developers to write code against and test applications.</li>
</ul>
These nine building blocks I feel are the bare minimum for any API area deployment.  I call this an API area because it is a simple dashboard, registration and tools to begin integration.  There is no community or living <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php" target="_blank">API ecosystem</a> yet.  I have a long way to go before that.<p></p>
Even though I am putting together all the content for my REST API area I have not decided whether I will build or buy this platform.  I am still discussing my goals with <a href="http://www.mashery.com" target="_blank">Mashery</a>, <a href="http://www.3scale.net" target="_blank">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://www.apigee.com" target="_blank">Apigee</a>.  Once I get quotes from them I will make a decision on which path I will choose.<p></p>
Regardless of whether I build or buy my API area these are the essential building blocks I need to open my API up for business.
