title: 'Google Alerts in Google Apps'
---
Google is rapidly retooling many of the FREE applications we've come to know, and launching within the <a href="http://www.google.com/a/" target="_blank">Google Apps</a> cloud platform.<p></p>
They released <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/11/now-available-with-google-apps-google_30.html" target="_blank">Google Alerts in the Google Apps</a> area today, allowing you to setup alerts within your companies domain.

I use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to help me discover new information on a daily basis. The keywords and phrases I search for change from week to week depending on my focus, currently they are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Print on Demand</li>
	<li>Print</li>
	<li>Publishing</li>
	<li>Cloud Computing</li>
	<li>Application Programming Interface</li>
</ul>
Google Alerts help me discover new blogs, sites and other information in these areas. It has become a primary method of discovery for me in my busy schedule, delivered in my inbox every evening. I can quickly scan the headlines to see if there are any important areas that I've missed in my daily blog consumption.<p></p>
I also forgot the most important Google Alert keyword search of all: <a href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">Kin Lane</a>. The vanity search is the best use of Google Alerts, allowing you to keep in tune with whats being said about you, and your reputation in tact.<p></p>
Google is rapidly <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/google-reader-in-my-google-apps/" target="_blank">migrating their key applications such as Google Reader</a> and Google Alerts to their Google Apps platform. With the Google Apps Marketplace and these key applications now available, the platform is becoming a much more viable business cloud computing platform.
