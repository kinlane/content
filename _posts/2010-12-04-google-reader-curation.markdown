title: 'Google Reader Curation'

<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google_reader_rss_icons.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />It is time to curate my Google Reader subscriptions again. I try to keep my daily blog reading as efficient as possible. To do this I change up my Google Reader in three different ways:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Google Reader Social Network</strong> - I follow people on Google Reader based upon their profile and how much they will contribute to my daily reading. I manually and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/12/evolve-my-google-reader-network/" target="_blank">programmatically evaluate other Google Reader users to see if they will be in my network</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Subscription Organization</strong> - Every 3-4 months I go through all my Google Reader subscriptions and organize them into folders and unsubscribe from irrelevant feeds.</li>
	<li><strong>New Feed Discovery </strong>- I search for new "source" RSS feeds from blogs of companies in particular research areas.</li>
</ol>
I needed to do a lot of house cleaning this round and remove subscriptions for Cloud Computing blogs. There has become a lot of spam in this space and a lot of sources have just gone silent. Not much new to say on the subject I guess.<p></p>
I am searching for API RSS subscriptions, so I went to the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb API directory</a> and added blogs from API service providers I feel are relevant. I have 65 API source blogs I'm following currently. Here is the <a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/reader/google-reader-subscriptions.xml" target="_blank">API Feed OPML file</a>. I will continue to add new subscriptions (and update OPML file), and curate specific posts from my feeds and share in my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/api-marketViaKinInGoogleReader/" target="_blank">API Industry RSS feed</a>.
