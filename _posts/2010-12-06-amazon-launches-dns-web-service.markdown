title: 'Amazon Launches DNS Web Service'
---
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Amazon added a DNS service to their stack of web services today The service is called Amazon Route 53.<p></p>
Now you can host your domains DNS with Amazon for $1.00 / month per zone and .50 cents per million queries.<p></p>
You can use the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53 DNS</a> for your Amazon infrastructure as well manage external resources as well.<p></p>
For my personal domains I tend to use the DNS that comes with the domain at GoDaddy. I have setup DNS services using Amazon EC2 instances, and now can stop doing this and rely on their new <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53 DNS</a> service.
