title: 'Marketplace and Platform Adoption'
---
I am spending a couple hours today going through popular app marketplaces looking for document management and collaboration applications. I'm also comparing each marketplace as browse through them..

I'm looking through four primary marketplaces:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/" target="_blank">Google Apps Marketplace</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sites.force.com/appexchange/home" target="_blank">Salesforce AppeExchange</a></li>
	<li><a href="www.evernote.com/about/trunk/%20" target="_blank">Evernote Trunk</a></li>
</ul>
I find applications from companies I've never heard of. It seems like a new way to discover tech products. I'm also seeing applications from big providers like box.net, eventbrite, etc.<p></p>
I'm thinking about the marketplace concept and how they influence my adoption of these applications:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/" target="_blank">Google Apps Marketplace</a> - I've installed a couple apps, but primarily if it isn't a Google offering I don't notice. See potential tough.</li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> - Brand new...just checking out.</li>
	<li><a href="http://sites.force.com/appexchange/home" target="_blank">Salesforce AppeExchange</a> - Interesting offerings and platform, but I am not a daily Salesforce user or developer.</li>
	<li><a href="www.evernote.com/about/trunk/ " target="_blank">Evernote Trunk</a> - I am dedicated Evernote user, but really haven't found anything here I would use. I see lots of good things, just nothing I'd use.</li>
</ul>
There is lots to think about when it comes to application marketplaces: Which ones we should pay attention to? Where we should consider building apps? Where we should consider partnering with existing players?<p></p>
While doing this research I also searched Google for more "application marketplaces":
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.android.com/market/#app=basesign.alltie" target="_blank">Android Marketplace</a> - Doh! of course. Can't forget about Android.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.home&amp;marketplaceid=1" target="_blank">Adobe Marketplace</a> - Makes sense to have a place for AIR apps.</li>
	<li><a href="https://creator.zoho.com/marketplace" target="_blank">Zoho Marketplace</a> - Collection of applications for Zoho platform.</li>
	<li><a href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone Marketplace</a> - Can't forget Window Mobile.</li>
	<li><a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/" target="_blank">Blackberry App Store</a> - Can't forget Blackberry either.</li>
</ul>
I then went through about 10 pages of Google results. A couple other no name marketplaces. What other top marketplaces am I missing?
