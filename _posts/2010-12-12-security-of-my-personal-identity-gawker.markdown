title: 'Security of My Personal Identity [Gawker]'

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13gawker.html"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/gawker_logo.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>I'm watching the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13gawker.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss" target="_blank">scene unfold with Gawker media</a>, and thinking about the security of my personal identity. The security of our personal online identities has <strong>ALWAYS</strong> been important, it just has a spotlight on it currently with Wikileaks and all the high profile DDOS and intrusive attacks in the last couple of weeks.<p></p>
My first thought is how thankful I am I use a 3 tier username / password structure for all of my accounts. This means I have 3 different sets of username / passwords I use:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>3rd Party Accounts</strong> - These are all external 3rd party services I use.</li>
	<li><strong>External / Public Facing Accounts</strong> - These are accounts I host but have public facing logins, like Wordpress, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Accounts </strong>- These are online banking, credit card, and load type accounts. Any account I have attached to $$$$.</li>
</ul>
I have commented on Lifehacker, a Gawker Media property. So my username / login identity for 3rd party accounts might be compromised. I run down my personal list of 3rd party accounts and change these. But my other 2 tiers are not compromised. This is a benefit of having a strategy for my personal account management<p></p>
My second thought is around OpenID. I have started using my <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/openid" target="_blank">Twitter OpenID</a> to login to many 3rd party services. This keeps my accounts centralized. 3rd party services NEVER have access to my username / password. Gawker media would never have my login information that I potentially use at other third party services.<p></p>
I can't be sure I've always used my Twitter account to authenticate across any one the Gawker real estate:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/gawker">Gawker</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/jezebel">Jezebel</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/gizmodo">Gizmodo</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/lifehacker">Lifehacker</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/deadspin">Deadspin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/io9">io9</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/kotaku">Kotaku</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/titles/jalopnik">Jalopnik</a></li>
</ul>
So I need to go to ALL my third party accounts and change my passwords. What a pain!!<p></p>
Maybe the time is ripe for everyone to take another look at <a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank">OpenID</a> and NOT signing up for service that don't give you an OpenID option for using their service?
