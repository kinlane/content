title: 'Mining of Massive Data Sets'

<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/database/mining-data-sets.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Mining of Massive Data Sets is a book evolved from material developed over several years by Anand Raja- raman and Jeff Ullman for a one-quarter course at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford</a>. The course titled Web Mining, was designed as an advanced graduate course, although it has become accessible and interesting to advanced undergraduates.<p></p>
At the highest level of description, this book is about data mining. However, it focuses on data mining of very large amounts of <a href="../category/data-20/">data</a>, that is, data so large it does not fit in main memory.<p></p>
The book takes an algorithmic point of view: data mining is about applying algorithms to data, rather than using data to train a machine-learning engine of some sort. The principal topics covered are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Distributed file systems and map-reduce as a tool for creating parallel algorithms that succeed on very large amounts of data.</li>
	<li>Similarity search, including the key techniques of  and locality- sensitive hashing.</li>
	<li>Data-stream processing and specialized algorithms for dealing with data that arrives so fast it must be processed immediately or lost.</li>
	<li>The technology of search engines, including <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a>'s PageRank, link-spam detection, and the hubs-and-authorities approach.</li>
	<li>Frequent-item set mining, including association rules, market-baskets, the A-Priori Algorithm and its improvements.</li>
	<li>Algorithms for clustering very large, high-dimensional datasets.</li>
	<li>Two key problems for Web applications: managing advertising and recommendation systems.</li>
</ul>
