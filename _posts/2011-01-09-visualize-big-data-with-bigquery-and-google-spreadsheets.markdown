title: 'Visualize Big Data with BigQuery and Google Spreadsheets'
---
Being the big data geek I am, I'm pretty excited that Google has integrated <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery">BigQuery</a> with <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google Apps Script</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a>.<p></p>
This means you can take power of BigQuery for storing and querying of very large data sets and combine them using Google Apps Scripts with any of your Google Spreadsheets.<p></p>
With a simple query Google Apps Script you can embed and process a query that pulls counts, fields and other information you use in spreadsheet columns and data visualizations.

You can upload VERY large sets of data like the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/docs/dataset-mlab.html">M-Lab dataset in BigQuery</a> which contains <strong>240B</strong> rows!<p></p>
I think this is an excellent example of the power of cloud computing. You can take a web application like Google Spreadsheet and truly harness the computer power of the cloud and make sense of large data sets.<p></p>
