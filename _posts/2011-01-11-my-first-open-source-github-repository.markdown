title: 'My First Open Source Github Repository'
---
I have checked out and downloaded code from plenty of <a href="http://github.com">github</a> repositories. I've even help manage a couple of private repositories for clients.
<a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
I have never actually shared an open source repository before. A virgin of sorts.<p></p>
I posted the <a href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Connect-Cloud-Print-API---REST-Client" target="_blank">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API PHP REST Client</a> today.  It is a simple PHP Class for consuming the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print REST API.<p></p>
It the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2/docs/latest/HTTP_Request2/_HTTP_Request2-0.5.1---Request2.php.html" target="_blank">PEAR Request2 librar</a>y to make REST calls against any of the REST service endpoints.<p></p>
It is the first of hopefully many code libraries and applications I will be open sourcing and publishing to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.
