<h2>Github as a Marketing Channel to Developers</h2>
<p>When marketing your API to developers you can't think like a regular marketer, you have to understand where developers are. Developers flock to platforms where they find the information, resources and community they need to be successful. &nbsp;Github is one of these places.</p>
<p>You want to make sure your API marketing efforts are targeted, just like other aspects of your companies outreach. &nbsp;Understanding where your customers exist online is critical, if they are on Facebook, Twitter or even Pinterest, that is where you work to reach them, and build relationships. &nbsp;When your product is an API, a large percentage of your customers will be developers, it makes sense that Github should be a significant part of your strategy.</p>
<p>Github isn't just about code, the social layers of Github open up marketing channels that are genuine, based around code and projects that have the potential to make developers lives easier. &nbsp;Github is a significant channel for marketing to developers, and is an excellent example of the merging of the mainstream with IT, and the potential of APIs to deliver value for not just developers, but also business and other departments.</p>
