title: 'Facebook Responds to Data Concerns'
---
Last week Facebook expanded the information available to external websites and applications to include profile address and mobile number.

Ummm....Not Cool.<p></p>
Today they responded with:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Over the weekend, we got some useful feedback that we could make people more clearly aware of when they are granting access to this data. We agree, and we are making changes to help ensure you only share this information when you intend to do so. We'll be working to launch these updates as soon as possible, and will be temporarily disabling this feature until those changes are ready. We look forward to re-enabling this improved feature in the next few weeks.</em>
I have to say I'm impressed with the speed of the response on a holiday weekend.<p></p>
Although it probably is something that could have been prevented with a couple women on the development team...just say'n. Its just not something thats obvious to guys some times. It would be nice to NOT have had the data exposure happen at all.
