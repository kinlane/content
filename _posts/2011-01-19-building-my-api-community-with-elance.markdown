title: 'Building My API Community with Elance'
---
I'm building the <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> area for the <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> Connect <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> API currently. When it is ready, I will need developers.<p></p>
I will need developers to write code samples, working on internal projects and be available to work on partner projects.<p></p>
I can't wait to build momentum and attract developers. I need developers now!<p></p>
I'm working on a strategy to build my community using the <a href="http://www.elance.com/" target="_blank">Elance expert community</a>. It is a ready to go community of developers.
<a href="http://www.mimeo.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
I'm working on some tools for:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Browsing Developers</li>
	<li>Searching Developers</li>
	<li>Viewing Developer Profiles</li>
	<li>Feature Developers</li>
	<li>Allow Developers to Connect Their Mimeo API Account with their Elance Account</li>
	<li>Integrate the Mimeo Cloud Print <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Community</a> with a Mimeo Elance Developer Group</li>
</ul>
I'm also working on other ways I can use Elance to build my API community:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=201">Contests</a> - Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print APIcontests.</li>
	<li>Hackathons - Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print API Hackathons.</li>
<a href="http://www.elance.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
	<li>Elance Groups - Establishing an Elance Group for the Mimeo Cloud Print API.</li>
	<li>Skills - Work to establish existing Elance skills needed, as well as establish new sets of skills.</li>
</ul>
I don't suffer from "Build It and They Will Come" Syndrome, I know the success of my API community depends on developers, and I need highly skilled ones right away. Elance seems like the best way to tap an existing community of skilled developer talent and seed my own API community.
