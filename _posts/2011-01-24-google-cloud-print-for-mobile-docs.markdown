Google Cloud Print for mobile allows you to print any document from your smartphone.  You can open a document in Google Docs or in Gmail using your mobile browser and choose "Print" from the dropdown menu in the top left corner.<p></p>
Currently you need to <a href="http://www.google.com/cloudprint" target="_blank">connect your printer to the Google Cloud Print</a> using a Windows PC. They are planning Linux and Mac support in the near future.<p></p>
They are rolling this feature out in the US for phones that support HTML5. This includes Android 2.1+ and IOS 3+.<p></p>
