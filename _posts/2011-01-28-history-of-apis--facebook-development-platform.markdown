<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>On August 15th 2006, <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207512130" target="_blank">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform</a> and API. <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Version 1.0 of the&nbsp; <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Development Platform</a> allowed developers access to Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile information for <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The API used REST, and responses were available in an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a> format, following common approaches by other social API providers of the time.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, developers began to build social applications, games, and mashups with the new development tools.</p>
<p>The Facebook Development Platform gave Facebook an edge over then popular competitor <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, and established itself as the top social gaming platform with games like <a href="http://www.farmville.com/" target="_blank">Farmville</a>.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: always;">While the Facebook API and platform is considered by many developers to be unstable, it continues to play a significant role in the evolution of the entire platform with applications and partnerships that drive new features and experiences on Facebook.</p>
