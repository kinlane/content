<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://blogs.worldbank.org/files/transport/taxi(1).jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> phones and <a class="zem_slink" title="Global Positioning System" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> gadgets infiltrate our every day lives, the opportunities for mining of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">big data</a> grows exponentially.<p></p>
I was just reading, <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/transport/node/563" target="_blank">They are sitting on a gold mine and don't even know itÂ….</a> from the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank Blog</a>.  They are talking about the huge <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/data-harvesting/">data mining</a> opportunities in analyzing transportation data in <a class="zem_slink" title="Emerging Markets" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Emerging_Markets">emerging markets</a>.<p></p>
With vehicles being outfitted with GPS, and humans having a GPS system in their pockets the amount of data being generated in real-time is staggering.<p></p>
When you start cross referencing this data with shopping, housing, food, and other vital data you start seeing huge gaps in infrastructure and commerce.<p></p>
This amount of data can be overwhelming, but put in the right hands we ca start making sense of some of the most pressing problems in emerging markets, and beyond.
