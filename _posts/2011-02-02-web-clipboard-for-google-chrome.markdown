title: 'Web Clipboard for Google Chrome'
---
I just installed the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/idonmcopbgceobhkdbikbdellmdogkih?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Web Clipboard</a> in my Google Chrome browser.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
It allows me to store text and HTML content and access it across any Google Apps.<p></p>
I like the concept of having a single cloud based clip-board.  I use <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/12/snippely-code-management/">Snippely for my code snippets</a>, which I would like to see be cloud-based.<p></p>
Now if Google would just create a simple IDE for the Google Apps suite I would be rock'n!
