<h2>Flickr</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> launched.  Six months later they launched their now <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by <a class="zem_slink" title="Yahoo!" rel="homepage" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo.</a></p>

<p>Flickr was originally created as an online game, but quickly evolved into a social photo sharing sensation.</p>
<p>The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/" target="_blank">Flickr API</a> is the driving inspiration behind the concept of <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">BizDev 2.0</a>, a term coined by Flickr co-founder <a href="http://caterina.net/" target="_blank">Caterina Fake</a>.&nbsp; Flickr couldn't keep up with the demand for its services, and established the API as a self-service way to deal with business development.</p>
<p>The core concepts established by Flickr using its API would transcend the company and its acquisition by Yahoo.&nbsp; Business development using APIs is embedded in the philosophy of the business of APIs pushing APIs to something beyond technical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs became something that any company could use to actually conduct business with its partners and the public, but we still had a ways to go before APIs would grow up.</p>
