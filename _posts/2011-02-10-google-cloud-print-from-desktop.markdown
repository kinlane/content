<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-cloud-print/google-mobile-cloud-print.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I was working on a demo today on<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Printing</a> from <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-apps-google/">Google Apps</a>. I wanted to go through the process of adding a <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> Google Cloud Printer to my Google Account, then be able to show on my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a> or <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a>.<p></p>
Displaying IPad or IPhone becomes more difficult in a presentation let alone a virtual presentation.<p></p>
So I set out looking for an IPhone emulator which I could show <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-docs/">Google Docs</a> on. They all work pretty weel, I just couldn't get Google Docs to show properly.<p></p>
Then I had an idea. I downloaded <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/" target="_blank">User Agent Switcher</a>, a Firefox Add-On. User Agent Switcher allows me to change my browser's user agent to whatever I want.<p></p>
I installed, restarted the browser, went to tools and changed my default user agent to IPhone 3.0.<p></p>
I refreshed my Google Docs page and when it reloaded I was viewing my Google Docs account using the mobile interface in my Firefox browser on my Macbook Pro.<p></p>
It was a quick and dirty way to be able to use Google Cloud Print in Google Apps from my Laptop, and since I don't use Firefox much I can leave Google Apps open and use my Google Cloud Print on my Macbook.
