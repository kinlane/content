title: 'Cloud Printing and Importance of the Google Docs Template Gallery'
---
As I'm planning and developing around the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> platform I'm starting to see a bigger picture.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/templates" target="_blank"><img style="paddng: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-cloud-print/google-docs-template-gallery-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
If <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-docs/">Google Docs</a> becomes a central point of storage and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">printing</a> via cloud printers, its value in the print supply chain becomes extremely valuable.<p></p>
If your creating, sharing, collaborating, storing and printing documents both personally and commercially using Google Docs,  this increases the need for higher quality Google Doc templates.<p></p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/templates" target="_blank">Google Docs Templates</a> is an assortment of documents, spreadsheets, presentations and drawings in various categories such as legal, business and statistics.<p></p>
Even with the ability to rank Google Doc templates, the directory is a mess of very poor quality randomness that people decided to submit as templates.<p></p>
As more companies adopt <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-apps-google/">Google Apps</a> as their primary cloud communication and document collaboration platform, and with the growth of it as a cloud printing platform you will see the quality of document templates rise.<p></p>
Google Docs and Google Docs template gallery will become a vital player in the personal, business and commercial cloud printing world.
