title: 'IPhone 4 Upgrade'
---
I just made the upgrade from my IPhone 3GS to IPhone 4. I 've been waiting because it is really a luxury, not a need.<p></p>
However my IPhone is getting slower and slower and was actually keeping me from doing work.

I chose not to have the store transfer my data, I enjoy doing myself and rewiring my world. Finding new ways of doing things if possible.<p></p>
I just finished downloading the handful of apps I use daily:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Evernote</li>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Foursquare</li>
</ul>
I have a Remote Desktop Client (<a class="zem_slink" title="Remote Desktop Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>) that is essential for server support, but not a daily use application.<p></p>
I found it interesting what apps I rely on daily. I tend to browse more than I rely on apps, even though I have downloaded quite a few, they don't stick.<p></p>
I'm sure Kaia will download plenty of games on there during the time(s) we are together, wait she has a new IPod?
