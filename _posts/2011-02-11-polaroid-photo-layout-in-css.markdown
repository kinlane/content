I came across a very well done tutorial called, <a href="http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-polaroid-photo-gallery" target="_blank">How To Create a Pure CSS Polaroid Photo Gallery</a>.<p></p>
I have modified somewhat for use as a photo book template, and published @ <a href="https://gist.github.com/823364" target="_blank">Github</a>.<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/823364.js?file=CSS%20Polaroid%20Photo%20Layout"></script><p></p>
I will be using this layout for several blog posts to come on building photo books with Flickr, Instagram and other photo sharing tools
