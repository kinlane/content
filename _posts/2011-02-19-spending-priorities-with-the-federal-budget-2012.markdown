As I see it I have two ways to express myself:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Voting</li>
	<li>Taxes</li>
</ol>
Voting always feels like I'm forced to pick the lesser of two evils. Very rarely do I ever have positive feelings about any political candidate.<p></p>
Paying taxes always feels like I have to give up 30% of my money to be spent on things that aren't important to me.<p></p>
I wouldn't mind paying taxes, as long as it is spent on things I feel are important.<p></p>
I'm supposed to voice myopinionon whats important to me by voting in a candidate that has the same priorities as me?<p></p>
Ok, say a candidate has the same priorities as me? Unlikely.  The candidate did, but do they once they get into office? Again unlikely.<p></p>
I want another way to voice my opinion on government spending priorities.  So I am building a tool.<p></p>
I imported the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2012 from PDFs (we'll talk abou this later). And created a tool that lets me login and set my priorities regarding the budet.<p></p>
I'm working on visualization tools, emailing, and social sharing tools next.<p></p>
I'm looking for BETA users to test and play with and give me feedback.
