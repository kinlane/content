<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-docs-icon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />As I'm spending a lot of time with Google Docs lately, I'm getting to see it in a different perspective.<p></p>
Google Docs has always been a singular document editor for me.  When you step back and look at it from 100K foot, you start to see a bigger picture.<p></p>
I'm seeing the potential of Google Docs as a publishing platform. Google Docs can support publishing in three main areas:<p></p>
<strong>Document Management</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Hand held, cellular access to creating, editing, sharing and publishing documents.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Smart Phone (Android, IPhone) - </strong>Applications and code libraries for most smart phone 		platforms.</li>
	<li><strong>Tablets (IPad) -</strong> Applications and code libraries for tablet platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Connectors</strong> -  Other companies provide Google Doc connectors for desktop and mobile platforms.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Memeo</strong> - Brings Google Docs files to your Desktop, iPad &amp; iPhone</li>
	<li><strong>Gladinet</strong> - Cloud desktop for Google Docs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Web</strong> - Superior web-based, cross platform document management application.</li>
	<li><strong>Language Translation -</strong> Language translate during upload and document management in over 50 langugages.</li>
	<li><strong>Format Conversion</strong> - Importing, document conversion, and exporting in multiple mainstream document forms.</li>
	<li><strong>Sharing / Permissions </strong>- Sharing and granular user permissions for viewing and editing documents.</li>
	<li><strong>Resumable Upload </strong>- Resumable upload for files through web interface and API, extending document management over lower quality Internet connections, and supporting large file format uploads.</li>
	<li><strong>OCR -</strong> <a class="zem_slink" title="Optical character recognition" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">Optical Character Recognition</a> transforming PDF and Images into text documents.</li>
	<li><strong>API -</strong> Programmatic access to all aspects Google Doc applications, allowing developers to integrate applications with Google Docs.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Document Storage</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Any Files up to 1GB -</strong> Allowing storage of any files up to 1GB in Google Docs.</li>
	<li><strong>Business Documents -</strong> Document, Presentation, Spreadsheet, Drawings - Uploading, creation, and exporting of the four most used types of business documents.</li>
	<li><strong>Pay as You Go Pricing -</strong> Pay for what you use cloud storage pricing model.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud Storage -</strong> Central personal and business storage on the Internet, and accessible from any Internet computer.</li>
	<li><strong>Template Marketplace -</strong> Central Google Doc template marketplace that can be used as templates for new Google Documents.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Document Publishing</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Web Publishing -</strong> Tools to publish Google Docs and make viewable by the public.  Embed and link tools for giving access.</li>
	<li><strong>Personal Cloud Printing </strong>- Printing of Google Docs from any mobile or desktop device to any printer over the Internet.</li>
	<li><strong>Office Cloud Printing -</strong> Printing of Google Docs from any mobile or desktop devices to any business or shared printer.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial Cloud Printing - </strong>Printing of Google Docs from any mobile or desktop devices to any commercial printer provider over the Internet.</li>
</ul>
Google is bringing together some very powerful document management tools for developers to take advantage of.<p></p>
As I'm planning for development of Google Cloud Printers, I am beginning to see much more opportunity for publishing beyond just a way to print, its a full blown publishing platform.
