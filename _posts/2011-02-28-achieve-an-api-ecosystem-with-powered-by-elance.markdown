title: 'Achieve an API Ecosystem with Powered by Elance'
---
Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work.   It just doesn't happen overnight.  It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work.

APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like <a title="Elance" href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a> are building the workforce to support the APIs.  You can leverage the Elance platform to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Providing High Quality, Professional Developers</li>
	<li>Develop API SDK and Code Samples</li>
	<li>Develop API skills test and accreditation</li>
</ul>
I have developed this prototype <a title="API developer area" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/">API developer area</a>, driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the <a title="Elance API" href="http://www.elance.com/p/api">Elance API.</a><p></p>
Using the power of the existing API developer community at <a title="Elance" href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a> you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.
