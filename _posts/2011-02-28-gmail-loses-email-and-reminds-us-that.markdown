<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/gmail-email-logo-envelope.plng.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm reading all the posts, tweets and streams about <a title="Gmail Loses Email" href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=3064c61f77cd0f46&amp;hl=en&amp;start=240">Google losing the emails of a whole bunch of Gmail accounts</a>.<p></p>
I see the the cloud computing naysayers stepping up with, "SEE, don't get too dependent on the cloud!"<p></p>
It reminds me of a company I worked at once, where after 48 hours of Microsoft Exchange server being down, IT held a meeting and said everyone's email accounts were removed and there were no backups.<p></p>
Everyone gets to start fresh with their email account!!<p></p>
The Gmail loss of emails reminds me....get dependent on whoever you want. Gmail, Microsoft or your companies IT.<p></p>
Just make sure you have a good quality backup process for ANY service you depend on.
