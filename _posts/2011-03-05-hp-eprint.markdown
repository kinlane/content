<a title="ePrint" href="http://h30495.www3.hp.com/?jumpid=in_R11549/eprintcenter">ePrint</a> is a service from HP that allows printing to select HP printers over the Internet.<p></p>
When an HP web connected printer registers it gets an email address. Since printers receive print jobs by email, this enables printing to any HP web enabled printer that is connected to the Internet.<p></p>
