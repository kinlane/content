Rapportive adds a social CRM layer to Gmail using Google Chrome or Firefox Add-Ons.<p></p>
When viewing an email received from a contact in Gmail, Rapportive automatically shows social profiles from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and others for the user in the sidebar.<p></p>
Rapportive now shows profile information for users, extracted from their profiles atBitbucket, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.<p></p>
Social CRM is definitely growing, but also usage of developer social networks as a real-time resume for developers is a new growth area as well.<p></p>
