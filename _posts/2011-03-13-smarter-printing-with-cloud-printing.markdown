<a href="http://www.mimeo.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I was attracted to my current job as the Mimeo Connect API evangelist because of the challenges associated with a print API.<p></p>
You have a collision of a dying industry and a game changing new technology.    I thought...this has to be a learning experience.   So I pursued the job.<p></p>
First thing I learned:  <em>Print isn't dead.</em> Its evolving, and the largest beasts in this industry (newspapers, magazines, book publishers) are too big to adjust, and they start wailing as they die.<p></p>
Print is far from dead.  It is still a big part of daily business operations around the world.  Technology like mobile phones and social networks are evolving print.<p></p>
Its not about print dying or going away, its about smarter printing.
