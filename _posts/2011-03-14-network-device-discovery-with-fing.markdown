<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/overlook-fing.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I was looking for a network device discovery tool.<p></p>
I want something that will run at the command line on multiple platforms.<p></p>
I came across<a title="Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">Fing from Overlook</a>.<p></p>
Fing is acommand line tool for <a title="Network and Service Discovery" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">network and service discovery.</a><p></p>
It can detect wireless and wired devices.<p></p>
It saves network device discovery results to a log file or to a CSV format.<p></p>
Fing runs on Windows Linux and Mac.  You can <a title="Download Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/index.php/download">download Fing</a> from the Overlook site..
