title: 'Building vs. Buying My API Area'
---
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />For the last four months I've been on a pretty wild ride trying to find a solution to delivering the Mimeo Connect Print API and its community.<p></p>
I looked at the three major API service providers, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  I also took a look at a new player, <a title="Mashape" href="http://www.mashape.com">Mashape</a>.<p></p>
After four months, whats the plan? I'm going to build my own API area.<p></p>
Keep in mind, I already have a REST API with everything I need.  I just don't have any supporting area, metrics, or security tools.<p></p>
I really like what the API service providers offer.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mashery</strong>, provides a powerful set of API management tools, resource and an extremely knowledgable team.   They also offer a lot of exposure for your API.</li>
	<li><strong>Apigee</strong>, provides a comparable set of tools to Mashery, with a more polished, "enterprisey" feel to it.  They don't seem to have the same public presence Mashery has, but are quickly catching up.</li>
</ul>
Both Mashery and Apigee proxies your API and acts as middleman between your data or functionality and the world.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>3Scale</strong> provides similar tools and services as Mashery and Apigee, but does this using a plugin you install on your server.  Then you use the 3Scale platform to meter calls and manage your community.</li>
	<li><strong>Mashape</strong> provides a pluging for deploying a RESTful API, but lacks some of the robust community tools offered by other providers. Although, Mashape does provide a marketplaceenvironmentfor APIs to get exposure.</li>
</ul>
All four API service providers offer some powerful tools for delivering our APIs.

Really it came down to cost.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Cost of hourly development for custom API work.</li>
	<li>Cost of per transactions on REST API.</li>
</ul>
I already have an API.  I just needs some metrics and an API area around it. Then I'd be open for business. So I'm a little ahead than other API operators.<p></p>
Next I have a lot of learning to do around our API.  Yes, any API owner does.  I have some other considerations when it comes to document building, printing and delivery costs that make my learning potentially very expensive. API to manufacturing isn't quite a proven area.<p></p>
This makes every hour spent and every API call made during research and development potentially costly.

I just couldn't sell the cost / value proposition to my executive team and justify the money I'd be spending with these API service provider.<p></p>
So I am:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Using my existing REST API</li>
	<li>Pulling together my own API area from various third party tools and some custom coding.</li>
</ul>
Then I am going to spend the next six months learning, understanding whats possible, playing with different prototypes and getting to know my developer community.<p></p>
Then we'll re-evaluate and see if an API service provider is right for me.<p></p>
