title: 'The Irony of Cutting Budget for Data.gov'
---
I refuse to align myself with any political party. When I vote for president its always a vote for the lesser of two evils.

My republican friends probably think I'm a liberal, my liberal friends probably think I'm aconservative.<p></p>
I'm pretty middle of the road.<p></p>
Even though I'm completely pissed off about<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/03/31/budget-technopocalypse-deepens-transparency-sites-will-go-dark-in-a-few-months/"> todaysannouncementsthat Data.gov,USASpending.gov and other government data sites will go dark because of spending cuts</a>....I can't help but see the irony.<p></p>
Republicans are on a spending cut rampage! Fight big government! Cut waste!!<p></p>
Democrats are just a bunch of pussies when it comes to cutting any real spending or increasing revenue by taxing the rich.<p></p>
To me cutting programs that create transparency in government and hold politicians accountable for their spending, is the ultimate in irony.<p></p>
It shows thehypocrisyof both Democrats and Republicans. Neither want transparency, because it shows them for what they are.<p></p>
Very sad day...
