<p><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>&nbsp;is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system, but the site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository. &nbsp;Making the platform much more than just code management, it is about building community around code.</p>
<p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong>&nbsp;- Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API</li>
<li><strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong>&nbsp;- Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area. Github provides a way for API owners to manage many aspects of API operations, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The social aspects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github. &nbsp;Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.</p>
<p>The native features of Git, plus the social features of Github make for an excellent combination for API providers. &nbsp;Using Github Pages in combination with the Github API allows for almost seamless integration to your existing API developer portal. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after: always;">Building an API community with Github isn't about building your own community or using just the existing Github community, it is about understand how you can best use Github and seamlessly integrating with your platform.</p>
