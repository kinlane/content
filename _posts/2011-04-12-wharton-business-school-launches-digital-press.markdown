<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/universities/wharton-digital-press.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania" href="http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</a> and its online business journal <a title="Knowledge@Wharton" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/">Knowledge@Wharton</a> has launched the <a title="Wharton Digital Press" href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Digital Press</a>.<p></p>
The school is looking to position itself as an entrpreneurial publisher, by making its business knowledge available in multiple formats from e-books,enhancedbooks, mobile apps and print-on-demand books.<p></p>
The digital press will target its regular business audience, by focusing on management and strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, finance and investment, leadership, marketing, operations, human resources, social responsibility, business-government relations, and more.<p></p>
<a title="Wharton Digital Press" href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Digital Press</a> will partner with authors and instead of a traditional advance, they will share the revenue from sales of the books.<p></p>
Interesting approach by a business school to take publishing to the next level by embracing electronic publishing, printing-on-demand and author revenue share models to control content and information on their own networks.
