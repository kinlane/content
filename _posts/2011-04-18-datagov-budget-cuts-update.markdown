Due to support of the Sunlight Foundation "Save the Data" campaign, the budget cuts were not as bad.<p></p>
Instead of cutting from $34 million to $2 million, the budgets is being reduced to $8 million.<p></p>
The Sunlight Foundation says, "we also have a pledge from Representative Issa, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to make sure these transparency programs don't die".<p></p>
There will be more chances to show support for these programs, with Congress considering a budget for 2012.<p></p>
Sunlight Foundation needs everyone tol keep fighting to Save the Data and make sure these transparency programs don't fade away.<p></p>
