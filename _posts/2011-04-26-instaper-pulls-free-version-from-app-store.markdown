<a href="http://www.instapaper.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instapaper.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> pulled its free version of its IPhone app from the Apple App Store over a month ago...and well, sales of the paid app are fine.<p></p>
<a title="Marco Arment" href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment">Marco Arment</a>, creator of Instapaper just tweeted:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment/status/63010410286166016">As an experiment, I temporarily pulled the Free app from the App Store over a month ago. Sales of the paid app remain great. Few complaints.</a>"</em>
What I like most about Arment and Instaper is he experiments with different monetization strategies for his app and API, and shares his thoughts and reasoning with the rest of the world.<p></p>
I think sharing the stories, as we are all figuring this out is important for the industry as a whole, and it is great marketing.<p></p>
Arment says it's not just about the money, it's about the product. And he'll blog in detail about it soon.<p></p>
