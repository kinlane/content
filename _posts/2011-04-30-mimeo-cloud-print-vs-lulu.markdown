<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2542797683272511"><a title="Mimeo.com" href="Mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> vs. <a title="Lulu.com" href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu.com</a></span>
<span>I wanted to help people understand the difference.</span><p></p>
<span>Lulu.com lets you make, self-publish, print and sell print-on-demand books, e-books, photo books and calendars.</span><p></p>
<span><a href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Platform</a> lets you build Lulu's.</span><p></p>
<span>This means you can build self-publishing web sites and applications that leverage the printing power of Mimeo.com</span>
