title: '3 Things To Add to Google Translate'
---
<a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a> is an amazing tool. It translates those random foreign web pages I run across, and those ever growing number of emails I receive from overseas.<a href="http://translate.google.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><p></p>
I have 3 suggestions for Google to add:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Geek</strong> - Translate geek so I can talk about technical things to my mom.</li>
	<li><strong>Legaleze</strong> - Translate terms of service and other legal documents so I can make sense of them.</li>
	<li><strong>Transportation</strong> - Translate those people speaking over the loudspeakers at airports, train and bus stations so I can understand them.</li>
</ol>
As you make Google Translate more useful for our everyday lives, I think these three additions would help immensly.
