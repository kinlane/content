Yesterday he posted a blog post titled, "<a title="A Month of Traffic to A VC" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/a-month-of-traffic-to-avc.html">A Month Of Traffic To A VC</a>".<p></p>
He shared what a months worth of traffic looks like to his <a title="A VC" href="http://www.avc.com/">A VC blog</a>.<p></p>
Now why would he do this?<p></p>
I think he genuinely wanted to share his thoughts on what contributes to a high traffic day on a blog.<p></p>
This made me think more about an idea I talked with <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> about the other day, about users taking control over our web history, social stream, and blog analytics.<p></p>
I have varying levels of control in these areas:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Web History</strong> - Google is very nice to share this with me, but it really isn't mine.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Stream</strong> - I generate my stream on Facebook and Twitter. I can pull this via the API and store locally if I wish, but it still isn't mine.</li>
	<li><strong>Blog Analytics </strong>- This is one area I feel I have a lot of control. Google gives me a very robust set of tools to manage, I can download reports and raw data via the API. But ultimately Google still has control.</li>
</ul>
What if there was a service provider out there that would connect to my social streams and blog analytics, and allow me to open up access to the highest bidder?<p></p>
I could sell access to my Twitter and Facebook data, andeven allow access to my browsing history.<p></p>
I would also be willing to share my Google Analytics for <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and <a title="apievangelist.com" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>. I get a decent amount of traffic to both blogs. I'm sure the information would be of value to someone.<p></p>
I would share this data, especially if I was able to make money from it. I'm sure my data would only be of value to tech companies, etc. But people who shop online a lot, would probably have data of interest to others users.<p></p>
A marketplace could be generated setting the value of web history, social stream, and blog traffic based upon volume and the type of data.<p></p>
Just another one of my rants, but sounds like an interesting startup idea for someone.<p></p>
Why speculate, get the data straight from the horses mouth.<p></p>
