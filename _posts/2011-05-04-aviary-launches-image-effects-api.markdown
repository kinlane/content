<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/aviary/aviary-effects-image.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Aviary" href="aviary.com">Aviary</a>, a creator of web-based image editing tools, <a title="launched a new Effects API" href="http://blog.aviary.com/aviarys-effects-api-and-new-developer-site/">launched a new Effects API</a> that can apply filters and utilities to photos via a RESTful interface.<p></p>
What used to be done with server-side components like <a title="ImageMagick" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-images-using-imagemagick/">ImageMagick</a>, can now be down through web APIs.<p></p>
The <a title="Aviary Effects API" href="http://developers.aviary.com/effects-api">Aviary Effects API</a> provides the following functionality:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Auto-Correction - Remove red eye, fix lighting, remove blurriness, perfect contrast and color levels</li>
	<li>Stylistic Filters - Apply retro, polaroid-esque, frames, comic book, with even more in production all the time</li>
	<li>Utilities - Smart-crop a photo to a person's face, rotate a photo, create thumbnails, and resize a batch of photos.</li>
</ul>
The Effects API provides predefined settings that work well with most photos, or you can fine-tune the effect with the built-in controls.<p></p>
Since the Effects API has a RESTful interface it works with web and mobile applications.<p></p>
The Effects API is the most recent addition to the Aviary family of APIs, which includes the <a title="Feather API" href="http://developers.aviary.com/featherapi">Feather API</a>, simple image editing, and <a title="Suite API" href="http://developers.aviary.com/suite-api">Suite API</a>, which allows users to launch any Aviary application from their web site.<p></p>
Along with the release of the Effects API, Aviary has launched a new <a title="area to support developers" href="http://developers.aviary.com/">area to support developers</a>, where you will find:<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/aviary/aviary-developer-area.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Simple explanation of all Aviary APIs on the homepage</li>
	<li>Separate section for each API, which includes more details, examples, and documentation</li>
	<li>Sandbox with place to test filter functionality.</li>
	<li>Complete demo version of feather</li>
	<li>Developer forum for developers to share and discover information.</li>
</ul>
The Effects API provides much needed tools for applications that are looking to build photo books, cards, posters and any other printed documents, where you will use photos and images.<p></p>
With the <a title="Feather API" href="http://developers.aviary.com/featherapi">Feather API</a> and <a title="Suite API" href="http://developers.aviary.com/suite-api">Suite API</a> you can even enable users of your application to create and manipulate images within your app before exporting to PDF and publishing to the<a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com"> Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.
