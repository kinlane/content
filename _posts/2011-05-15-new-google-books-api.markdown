Google <a title="released a new Google Books API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-books-api-for-developers.html">released a new Google Books API</a> this week. The new Books API will allow developers to build mobile and web applications using the more than 15 million books titles available on books.google.com.<p></p>
The <a title="Books API" href="https://code.google.com/apis/books/docs/v1/using.html">Books API</a> allows searching of books metadata, pricing and working with users Google Book accounts to retrieve and manage their bookshelves and the titles they contain.<p></p>

<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>OAuth 2.0 support</li>
	<li>Integration with the <a title="Google APIs Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">Google APIs Console</a></li>
	<li>Library support for multiple programming languages</li>

</ul>
Book titles that allow for downloading, return a link to the full book. Currently only ePub is the only supportd format, and some books may require purchasing before a download link is provided.<p></p>
The previous GData API and Javascript API will still be available, but ongoing development work will be focused on the new Google Books API.
