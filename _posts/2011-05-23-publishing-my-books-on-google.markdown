title: 'Publishing My Books On Google'
---
I've started exploring <a title="Google Books" href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> as a publishing platform for my books. I write my own books, but I want to explore what it looks like to be a publisher using Google Books and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print.<p></p>
<span>As a publisher, Google Book allows me to:</span><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-books-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Increase awareness of my book titles</li>
	<li>Publish and promote at no cost</li>
	<li>Reach Google's worldwide user base</li>
	<li>Refer qualified traffic to my website</li>
	<li>Help Users Find Your Books</li>
</ul>
<span>First I will be uploading my titles to Google Books as PDF, then by matching the content in my book with user searches, Google Books will connects my titles books with the users who are most interested in buying them.</span><p></p>
<span>Each Google Books result will display the book's title and author, a short excerpt containing the highlighted search terms, and other public data about the book.</span><p></p>
<span>When a user clicks on one of my your book titles from a search results page, it takes users to a limited preview of the title - just enough to give them a taste of the book, as if they were browsing in a bookstore or library.</span><p></p>
<span>The book detail page will link to bookstores and online retailers makign it easy for users to go from browsing to buying. I will be building a custom <a title="print on demand solution using Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">print on demand solution using Mimeo Connect</a> that is integrated with my website. My site will receive top billing, appearing first in the list of purchase links. A Google Books previews also appear on book-related sites like online retailers and social book networks.</span><p></p>
<span>Google Books will also give me online reports that let me manage my account information, view how many consumers have looked at my titles, see click rates on purchase links, and review other stats related to the Google Books program.</span><p></p>
<span>I will be playing with the Google Books publishing program and blog about my findings and results here, so that other users can follow along and potential build their own publishing solutions using Google Books and <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print</a>.</span>
