title: 'Google I/O Samsung Galaxy Tablet Review'
---
Its been a month since <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/">Google I/O</a>.  I figured its about time to do a write-up about the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxytab/10.1/index.html">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a> that Google was so kind to give me at the event.<p></p>
I've been using it since, and I will be keeping it as my primary tablet device.   I even gave my IPad to my daughter to seal the deal.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxytab/10.1/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-google-io-edition.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>For me the Samsung Galaxy is more functional as an actual working device, than the IPad ever was.<p></p>
To make work for me, here are the applications I use:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google Apps</li>
	<li>Evernote</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>StumbleUpon</li>
</ul>
That is all I need.  All I really do on my tablet is consume information. I primarily use Google Reader, Twitter, StumbleUpon, and my browser as my information consumption tools.<p></p>
However as I consume my feeds, I need to be able to bookmark, share and save things for reading later.  Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and StumbleUpon do this for me.<p></p>
While I consume my feeds it is also nice to be able to communicate and socialize with everyone in all my networks.  I use Gmail, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn for this.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/android.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-evernote.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Beyond that, the only creation I say I do on the Galaxy Tab is brainstorming and notetaking with Evernote.  Evernote on a tablet is extremely useful, and I couldn't do without it.<p></p>
Beyond that, the camera and gallery tool is fun to use.  I know IPad 2 has a camera, so this one isn't fair.  However the gallery tool sucked in all my photos automatically from Picassa, and I spent the next couple weeks browsing photos I've haven't looked at in years.<p></p>
Also...I actually downloaded Amazon Kindle, bought a book and read it cover to cover. Wait can you still say that? Anyways, never did this on the IPad. Not sure why.<p></p>
I feel the Android notifications keeps me plugged into my email, calendar, social networks and other tools, in a way that I feel still connected and monitoring my world in real-time.  The IPad always felt I was off in left field, unless I made an effort to look at things.  I didn't really flow between apps and the browser, staying in tune with multiple sources, on the IPad.<p></p>
Two things I do not like:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Netflix</strong> - Netflix App doesn't work.  Nuff said.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Reader </strong>- Don't like the Google Reader App, just use the web app.</li>
</ul>
Over all, the Galaxy Tab just works well for me.  I'm not saying its for everyone, but as a tablet, I found it more useful than the IPad.  It has proven to be a nice extension to my Macbook.<p></p>
Thanks Google!
