<a title="Pen.io" href="http://pen.io/"><img style="padding: 25 px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pen-io-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I really enjoy web applications that focus on doing one thing, and doing it well.<p></p>
<a title="Pen.io" href="http://pen.io/">Pen.io</a> is one of these apps. Pen.io is the fastest way to publish online. period.<p></p>
Pen.io allows you to add, edit, and delete pages.  Thats it.<p></p>
You just give your page a title, set a password, and add.  Then you can edit the body of your page and publish.<p></p>
<a title="Pen.io just launched a new API" href="http://pen.io/api/">Pen.io just launched a new API</a> to support the web application.  It allows you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Authenticate</li>
	<li>Create New Page</li>
	<li>Update Page Content</li>
	<li>Check Page Availability</li>
	<li>Get Page in HTML Format</li>
	<li>Get Page in JSON Format</li>
	<li>Get Page in XML Format</li>
	<li>Delete a Page</li>
</ul>
The <a title="Pen.io API" href="http://pen.io/api/">Pen.io API</a> is RESTful and authenticates using an application key in the header.<p></p>
They provide a directory of pages, about, blog, faq, and contact page.<p></p>
It doesn't get much simpler than that.  It is a very elegant representation of a Software as a Service for a single resource.
