<a href="http://www.box.net/" target="_blank">Box.net</a> has <a title="announced new integration" href="http://blog.box.net/2011/06/22/box-and-google-docs-accelerating-the-cloud-workforce/">announced new integration</a> with the Google Docs Platform.  Box.net users can now create, edit and collaborate using <a href="http://www.docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>, while logged into their regular Box.net account.<p></p>
This type of interoperability between cloud storage is very import to cloud adoption.  I personally use both cloud storage environments, but for very different reasons.<p></p>
I use Box.net for higher quality storage of business documents like my presentation materials, high resolution images, and other documents I'm likely to print.  I can print <a title="single sheet with box.net" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">single sheet</a>, <a title="bound document with box.net" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">bound documents</a> or posters using my Box.net.<p></p>
Since I do a lot of my document creation at Google Docs, and store my more completed materials on Box.net it is very helpful to have access between the two services.<p></p>

I can create and collaboration on document creation on Google Docs, then migrate that over to Box.net for use in various demos, presentations, and talks.  Then I can also generate print materials using the Box.net API and <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/">Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>
This type of interoperability is a perfect opportunity to use different cloud storage environments based upon your companies usage, what vendors and clients use, or just purely because of your preference.<p></p>
I will be printing from Google Docs using <a title="Google Cloud Printer" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/search_tag.php?tags=Google%20Cloud%20Print">Google Cloud Print</a>, and Box.net just to keep fluent in how to print on demand from both Box.net and Google Apps.
