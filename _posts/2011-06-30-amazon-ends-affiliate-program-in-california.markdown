title: 'Amazon Ends Affiliate Program in California'
---
<a title="Amazon Affiliate Program" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/affiliate/amazon-affiliates.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Amazon sent me an email about the recent <a title="signing of the online sales tax law, by California Governor Brown" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_18282733" target="_blank">signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown</a>, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.<p></p>
As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the <a title="Amazon Affiliate Program" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Associates Program</a> are terminated effective today, June 29, 2011.<p></p>
California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to<a title="amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>,<a title="Endless.com" href="http://www.endless.com" target="_blank">Endless.com</a>,<a title="MYHABIT.COM" href="http://www.myhabit.com" target="_blank">MYHABIT.COM</a> and<a title="SmallParts.com" href="http://www.mallParts.com." target="_blank">SmallParts.com</a>.<p></p>
My Amazon Associate profile is registered to my California address, but I can easily change to my house in Oregon, to keep active.<p></p>
Lawmakers calculate it will net the state $200 million in additional revenues. I can't help but think how many affiliates will just relocate out of state and conduct business outside of California.<p></p>
These are Internet businesses, I don't think moving them will be very hard.
