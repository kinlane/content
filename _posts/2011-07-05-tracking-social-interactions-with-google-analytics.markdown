<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/analytics/Google-Analytics-Social-Engagment.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time this week <a title="updating my social sharing buttons" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/07/updated-blog-sharing/">updating my social sharing buttons</a>, <a title="claiming authorship of my blog posts, and linking with my Google profiles" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/07/claiming-my-blog-posts-and-social-profiles/">claiming authorship of my blog posts, and linking with my Google profiles</a>.<p></p>
A big part of this is also to update my <a title="Google Analytics to track social interactions" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSocial.html">Google Analytics to track social interactions</a> with <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and <a title="blog.apievangelist.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">blog.apievangelist.com</a>.<p></p>
If you have set up both Google +1 and the latest version of Google Analytics on the same page, all +1 social interactions will be tracked automatically.<p></p>
To get social interaction tracking and reporting for other networks like Facebook or Twitter, you need to integrate Google Analytics tracking along with each network button.<p></p>
Using Google Analytics Social Tracking, you can record interactions range from a Facebook "Like" to a Twitter "Tweet." This allows me to view track on these social interactions along with other traffic to my blogs, in my Google Analytics dashboard.<p></p>
I added tracking for Facebook recommendations:<p></p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066419.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>Also added tracking for Facebook shares:<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066428.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script><p></p>
Then I added tracking for tweets:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1066430.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script><p></p>
There were not ready to go scripts for tracking LinkedIn and StumbleUpon. I will be working on these as I can, so that I can track shares from my blogs to these social networking and bookmark sites.
