<img src="http://photoduino.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/_img/en/introduction.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" /><strong><a title="Photoduino" href="http://code.google.com/p/photoduino/wiki/Introduction">Photoduino</a></strong>is an open source camera controller based on the<strong><a title="Arduino Platform" href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino platform</a></strong>.<p></p>
It is designed to take photographs using various techniques such as time-lapses, high speed photography, photography of animals, and storms photography.<p></p>
The electronic circuit is capable to control autofocus and shutter of a camera and two separate manuals flashes. It also has a sound sensor, an impact/shock sensor, a laser barrier and an infrared barrier that can be used to take pictures when an event is registered.<p></p>
The system is currently compatible with<a href="http://code.google.com/p/photoduino/wiki/CameraReference">multitude of cameras</a>but may be adaptable in the future to other models and brands that have remote shutter connector cable.<p></p>
Both the hardware as their firmware are completely free and open and are published under<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" rel="nofollow">GPLv3</a>, just as the<strong>Arduino platform</strong>in which it is based.
