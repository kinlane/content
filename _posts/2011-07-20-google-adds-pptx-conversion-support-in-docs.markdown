Google has <a title="added support for converting Powerpoint .pptx files to Google presentations" href="https://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=186466">added support for converting Powerpoint .pptx files to Google presentations</a>when uploading using Google Docs or via the API.<p></p>
Until now Google only supported the older versions of Powerpoint .ppt when uploading and converting.<p></p>
Here is a complete list of file types that can be converted to Google Docs as of today:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>For spreadsheets - .xls, .xlsx, .ods, .csv, .tsv, .txt, .tab</li>
	<li>For documents - .doc, .docx, .html, plain text (.txt), .rtf</li>
	<li>For presentations - .ppt, .pps, .pptx</li>
	<li>For drawings - .wmf</li>
</ul>
The lack of support for uploading .pptx files to Google Docs was kind of a large missing piece for users trying to replace Microsoft Office with Google Docs. If you couldn't work with the latest software file versions, it made it very difficult to operate on a daily basis, especially when publishing.<p></p>
I will play with uploading of Powerpoint .pptx files to Google Docs, and outputting as <a title="PDF for printing and publishing presentations with Mimeo Connect" href="../../index.php">PDF for printing and publishing presentations with Mimeo Connect</a>.
