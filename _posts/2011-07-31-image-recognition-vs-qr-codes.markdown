title: 'Image Recognition vs. QR Codes'

<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" />I wrote a post last month called, <a title="Are QR Codes Relevant Anymore" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/06/are-qr-codes-relevant-anymore/">Are QR Codes Relevant Anymore</a>? In a world where everyone has a camera phone, and with image recognition technology like <a title="Google Googles" href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/">Google Googles</a>, are QR codes a realistic way to bridge the physical world with our online lives?<p></p>
I have been a big fan of QR codes for years, and I think other supporters will keep them alive for years to come. But there are a lot of really cool technologies emerging, like <a title="Moodstocks API" href="https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-api/wiki/api-v2-doc">Moodstocks API</a>.<p></p>
The Moodstocks API is low cost image recognition service, that allows any developer to build in object recognition into their own applications. Developers can record object reference images with the API, that set a definition for searches using the image recognition API. This allows you to create an image definition of any object you like, and attach any meaning to it you wish via your application.<p></p>
You can even use Moodstocks API for barcode and QR code recognition. So with this kind of object recognition power, is the concept of a QR code even relevant?<p></p>
There are some really cool apps being built around the Moodstocks API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Augmentedev</strong> - Augmentedev is an awesome augmented reality app that lets you experience products with your phone</li>
	<li><strong>Qooery</strong> - Qooery lets you turn objects into hashtags. It's as easy as tweeting an object with its pic and mentioning @qooery</li>
	<li><strong>Castorama</strong> - Scan any product in the catalogue and learn how to use it, and where to buy it! You can even order it right from your phone</li>
	<li><strong>My Auchan</strong> - Scan catalogues flyers posters and packaging to get additional information related to products and add them to your purchase list</li>
	<li><strong>Moodstocks Notes</strong> - Scan any object to share and see reviews on the go! Works great for wine labels, movie posters, book covers, or perfume packaging</li>
	<li><strong>Gaumont Pathé</strong> - Scan movie posters wherever they may be (streets, tube stations, bus stops, ...) to watch the trailer and book your next movie session</li>
</ul>
Moodstocks makes some other suggestions about uses cases for the image recognition API:<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/moodstocks/Moodstocks-Mobile-Search.png" alt="" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Download articles</strong> - Taking the bus is boring. So boring. Luckily you didn't forget your free newspaper. There's one article you'd like to remember. Why not scan it to save the pdf version?</li>
	<li><strong>Save contact details</strong> - You're attending a great tech event. You've met many brilliant people so far. But business cards are not handy. It would be much easier to just scan them to save contact details right into your address book!</li>
	<li><strong>Book your cinema ticket</strong> - You're waiting for the tube. You're bored. You see a movie poster. It looks interesting. What about scanning it to see the trailer and book a ticket for the week-end?</li>
	<li><strong>Read reviews</strong> - You have a dinner tonight. You need to buy some wine. At the grocery store you're overwhelmed with so much choice. It would be so cool to read reviews. Just scan the labels you're interested in!</li>
	<li><strong>Compare prices</strong> - Say you're in a DVD store. You're about to buy this movie you've wanted for so long. Wait a minute! You can maybe find it online for a better price. Scan it, you'll know!</li>
	<li><strong>Manage your purchase list</strong> - You've just received a new flyer from your supermarket. Plenty of sweet deals. What about adding them right now to your purchase list? All you need is scanning!</li>
	<li><strong>Order a product</strong> - Your favorite fashion brand sends you a catalogue as usual before summer time. There is this bag you love so much. You want to buy it right here right now. Scan it, you're done!</li>
	<li><strong>Ask friends</strong> - You're hanging around downtown. You see a concert poster. It looks great! Scan it, see who likes it among your Facebook friends and let the others know about it!</li>
	<li><strong>Get coupons</strong> - You're having a drink with a bunch of friends. Oh yeah: a fresh beer is always nice But did you know that it could get even nicer? If you scan it you might save money!</li>
</ul>
Those are some pretty cool examples of applications that use image recognition. There is too much momentum behind the QR code movement to say QR codes are dead. But I can't imagine they will find much more adoption with <a title="image recognition technology like Moodstocks API" href="http://www.moodstocks.com/">image recognition technology like Moodstocks API</a>, allowing us to derive meaning and a definition for any object we take pictures of.
