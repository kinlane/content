One of the most common types of integrations I've been doing lately are <a title="signle sign on (SSO) integrations with print marketplaces" href="../../marketplace-sso.php">single sign on (SSO) integrations with print marketplaces</a>. On this blog, most of the time I talk about REST API integration with Mimeo, so I wanted to spend some time talking about Mimeo Marketplace integration.<p></p>
A <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/solutions/mimeo-marketplace.php">Mimeo Marketplace</a> let's you create your own customized online storefront, publish documents, and let others do the ordering ... reducing the time, expense, and resources of pre-printing, storing, and distributing publications yourself. Mimeo prints the documents on-demand and ships them where and when they are needed, even overnight!<p></p>
There are two primary ways customers can programmatically integrate with their Mimeo Marketplaces:
<ul class="blue">
	<li><strong><a title="Single Sign On" href="../../marketplace-sso.php">Single Sign On (SSO)</a> </strong>- You can route users from your web site or application directly to a marketplace and immediatley sign them on to their existing user account or create a new Mimeo account for ordering.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="REST API" href="../../documentation/service_detail.php?ID=2">REST API </a></strong>- Direct integration with your Mimeo Marketplace via our RESTful API and add, edit, updated and delete product categories and print products within these categories.</li>
</ul>
Mimeo Marketplaces are free to setup as part of your <a title="Mimeo Account" href="https://my.mimeo.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f">Mimeo Account</a>, and you can setup both public and private marketplaces.<p></p>
I've seen some pretty cool print on demand marketplaces setup for everything ranging from learning management system materials to old shakespeare plays for high school. Mimeo Connect allows you to integrate a marketplace directly into your existing web site or application, adding print on demand for all of your content, documents and publications.<p></p>
I'm going to write more specifically on SSO and integration with <a title="Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect</a> using the print marketplace service on our API.<p></p>
Stay tuned!
