I just added a new entry to the<a title="Mimeo Idea Shhowcase" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/ideas.php">Mimeo Idea Showcase</a>. It is an idea for<a title="personalized print on demand coupon books" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/idea_detail.php?ID=25">personalized, print-on-demand coupon books</a>.<p></p>
This idea comes from my co-worker Heath. His thoughts are:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Seems like a subscription service to pick the stores near you have coupon books printed and delivered from a site like Coupon Cabin, would be pretty cool. A rare case where the printed pages have true monetary value.</em>
<a title="Coupon Cabin" href="http://www.couponcabin.com/printable-coupons/">Coupon Cabin</a>searches, aggregates and verifies printable in-store coupons from offline retail stores. Users can browse the site and find coupons for the things they need, print and use.<p></p>
The site doesn't have an API (I will contact them and find out more), but it does have an RSS feed. Someone could easily pull real-time data and allow users to browse and search coupons, select the coupons they want and build book from and print one or many copies.<p></p>
This could be done on an individual basis or for specific locations or types of products and services. As Heath said, its definitely a rare case when the printed pages have true monetary value.
