<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>.  I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term.  At the <a title="AT&amp;T Hackathon" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas</a> , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event.  I was asked by one guy, &ldquo;Are all these people trying to hack someone&rsquo;s network?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term.  Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings</li>
<li>To break up the surface of soil</li>
<li>To alter a computer program</li>
<li>To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization</li>
<li>To cut or mutilate as if by hacking</li>
<li>To cope with successfully</li>
<li>To chop or cut something by hacking</li>
<li>To write or refine computer programs skillfully</li>
<li>To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network</li>
<li>To cough roughly or harshly</li>
<li>A rough, irregular cut made by hacking</li>
<li>A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking</li>
<li>A blow made by hacking</li>
<li>A rough, dry cough</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition I&rsquo;ve heard, and prefer is:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you&rsquo;d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.</p>
