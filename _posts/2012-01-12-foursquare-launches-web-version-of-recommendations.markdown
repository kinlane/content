<p>Last March during SXSW 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare Launched" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/08/foursquare-3/">Foursquare launched</a>&nbsp;explore for&nbsp;<a title="iPhone and Android for Mobile" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/SDKs">iPhone and Android mobile</a>, allowing users to find things to do nearby, and now has brought this same&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;to the web.</p>
<p>Explore's suggestions are &nbsp;powered by places you've been and frequented, the places your friends have visited, the categories and types of places you prefer, what&rsquo;s popular with other users, the day of the week, places with great tips, the time of day and a whole bunch of intelligent criteria.</p>
<p>This move by Foursquare shows the power of the checkin and applying your checkins, and your social network&rsquo;s checkins history toward local recommendations, shaping the&nbsp;<a title="Places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a>&nbsp;you will go in the future.</p>
<p>The benefits offered by this type of socially driven local recommendations, creates an powerful new set of incentives for mobile users to check-in, one that goes beyond badges and mayor-ship.</p>
<p>Foursquare Explore shows the local check-in has definitely come of age.</p>
