<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-493" title="simplegeo-to-citygrid" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/simplegeo-to-citygrid-300x132.png" alt="" width="300" height="132" align="right" />With&nbsp;<a title="Urban Airship shutting down SimpleGeo" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/urban-airship-shutting-down-simplegeo/">Urban AirShip shutting down SimpleGeo</a>&nbsp;there are many developers left with the decision of where to go next, to get their places data, as well as context, storage and geocoding services.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>&nbsp;does not provide context, storage and geocoding services, but we can provide rich places data that developers can use in their web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Developers can make up to as many as 10 million queries a month for FREE, all you need is to&nbsp;<a title="register for a publisher code" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/dashboard/registration">register for a publisher code</a>, and tell us a little about your application.</p>
<p>In addition to FREE access to over 15 million places, CityGrid provides millions of pieces of&nbsp;<a title="enhanced local content" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">enhanced local content</a>, including user reviews, deals and offers, photos and videos, social media details, menus, reservations and more.</p>
<p>Next CityGrid provides something you could not get with SimpleGeo places data--the ability to generate revenue from your mobile and web apps. &nbsp;CityGrid provides&nbsp;<a title="web advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Web+Ads+API">web</a>,&nbsp;<a title="mobile advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Mobile+Ads+API">mobile</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="custom ads" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Custom+Ads+API">custom ads</a>, developers can use to monetize their apps. &nbsp;In addition to advertising you can be paid to just display certain places with&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">CityGrid Places that Pay</a>.</p>
<p>All you need to get started with CityGrid is a publisher code. &nbsp;CityGrid APIs are RESTful and you can search for places using a&nbsp;<a title="geographic search" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Custom+Ads+API#CustomAdsAPI-ObtainingCustomAdsbyNamedGeographicRegion">geographic search</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a title="longitude and latitude" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API#PlacesAPI-SearchUsingLatitudeandLongitude">longitude and latitude</a>, an get search or places detail responses in either XML or JSON.</p>
<p>When looking for a replacement to your SimpleGeo places data, take a look at the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>, and rather than paying for your places data, let CityGrid pay you for using ours.</p>
