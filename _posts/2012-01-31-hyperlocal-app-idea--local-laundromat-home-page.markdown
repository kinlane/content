<p><a href="http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/140772/manhattan_beach_ca/wash_tub.html"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-568" title="laundromat" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/laundromat-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I am sitting at the&nbsp;<a title="Wash Tub Laundromat in Manhattan Beach, CA" href="http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/140772/manhattan_beach_ca/wash_tub.html">Wash Tub Laundromat in Manhattan Beach, CA</a>&nbsp;doing my laundry tonight. I was working on my Macbook and the owner of the laundromat asked me if I was able to get wifi on my laptop?</p>
<p>I explained that I have a Verizon USB stick to get my Internet connection, since there wasn&rsquo;t wifi available. He said he had talked to Time Warner Cable and they said they&rsquo;d install free Internet for him, but it had been months and nothing. I&rsquo;m assuming they have some sort of public spaces package that routes users to a home page, upon connecting and monetizes the Internet using advertising.</p>
<p>The laundromat owner said he&rsquo;d just pay for Internet himself. I told him about&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Local Advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">CityGrid local advertising,</a>&nbsp;and said he could monetize the home page and probably end up paying for the Internet through local advertising.</p>
<p>Seems like a great idea for a local web application, one that helps laundromat, coffee shop and other business owners set up a default home page for their router, and make money from it using&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Places and Advertising" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid local places and advertising</a>.</p>
<p>It would be easy to go beyond just ads on a single splash page and build a quality local directory that introduces customers to other products, services and business in the local area.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m traveling, and talking to small business owners about ideas for web and mobile apps, I will keep sharing with developers here, so you can take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
