A few weeks ago, more than 60 new timeline apps went live. These apps - many in the lifestyle category - broadened what was available to people on Facebook beyond the music, news and video apps that were introduced at f8 in September. Music apps like Spotify, Songza and Deezer are seeing dramatic increases in sharing and music discovery.</li>
<li><a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Announcing The Facebook Mobile Platform Global Hacks Roadshow- Europe</a>&nbsp;- (02/13/2012) - In October, we announced the Facebook Mobile Platform, bringing social channels and distribution to mobile apps. Since then, momentum has been building, and today, more than 60 million visitors interact with apps and games on the platform every month. In October we also invited mobile developers to join us for a Mobile Hack in Palo Alto. We later visited mobile developers in New York and Boston to hold similar events. Hundreds joined us at each event, learned about the Facebook Mobile Platform, worked on mobile hack projects, and presented them to panels of VCs and tech executives. We were thrilled that these mobile hack events attracted developers from around the world, from as far afield as London, Israel and Brazil.</li>

We apologize for sending the emails all at once and any confusion that this may have caused. Please let us know if you have any questions in the comments below.</li>
