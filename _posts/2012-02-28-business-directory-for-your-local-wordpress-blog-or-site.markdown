<p>I finished the first version of a <a title="business directory wordpress plugin" href="http://wordpress-local-directory.hyp3rl0cal.com/">business directory WordPress plugin</a> that you can use to deploy a local directory for your Wordpress site or blog.  I wanted to make an easy way for non-developers, to launch a local directory for one or multiple business categories.</p>
<p>The Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin uses two APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid Places API</a></li>
<li><a title="CityGrid Advertising API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">CityGrid Advertising API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To install the CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin you have two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Search for it and install using the Plugin Search in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Wordpress site (this is the easiest).</li>
<li>Download it from the <a title="CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyp3rl0cal-wordpress-plugin/">Wordpress plugin directory</a> or via <a title="CityGrid hyp3rl0cal Wordpress Plugin on Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/Hyp3rL0cal-Wordpress-Plugin">Github</a>, and upload using the "plugin upload" in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Wordpress site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once installed you should see a new menu in your Wordpress admin menu, called CityGrid.  It contains an overview of the plugin and a setting page for configuring your Wordpress directory.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/citygrid/citygrid_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using the settings page you can configure five elements of your local business directory:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>CityGrid Publisher Code</strong> - The API key that gives you access to CityGrid business data.</li>
<li><strong>Directory Label</strong> - What your directory will be called on your sites menu.</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> - A location of "where" you want to provide a search for, this can include: Cities, Neighborhoods, Zip Codes, Metro Areas, Addresses and Intersections.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> - Keywords separated by commas (pizza, pubs, hair salon, auto parts). Each keyword or phrase will create new page and directory.</li>
<li><strong>Ads</strong> - Whether or not you want to show ads on your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to find strike a balance between simplicity, while also giving site owners a very robust local directory for their site.  My goal is to empower non-developers with the ability to launch local business directories for any topic or geographic location at a city level.</p>
