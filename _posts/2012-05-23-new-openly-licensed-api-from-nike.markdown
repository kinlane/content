<p>I was writing a story on <a title="Nike&rsquo;s new Sustainable Products Index API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/23/nike-sustainable-products-index-api/">Nike&rsquo;s new Sustainable Products Index API</a> for API Evangelist, and beyond the business use of the API I noticed the interesting licensing Nike decide to use for the data and the API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>This data is bound by the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/" target="_blank">Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0</a></li>
<li>The API is bound by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Its good to see Nike license this important data under ODbL, allowing developers to freely share, create and adapt as long as you attribute, share-alike and keep the data open.</p>
<p>It was also interesting to see Nike license the API itself under the GNU license, keeping the API interface free and accessible for other people to use, keeping setting a publicly accessible standard for sustainable products index APIs.</p>
