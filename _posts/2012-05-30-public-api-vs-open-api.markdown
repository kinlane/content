title: 'Public API vs. Open API'
---
<p>I see the term "open API" used a lot out there in the API space.   I feel there are truly very few actual open APIs, but the term has been co-opted by the media, many API owners as well as API service providers.</p>
<p>The only two open APIs I can think of, off the top of my head are:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API">OpenStreeMaps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more, but will have to do some more research to identify them.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what makes an open API?</strong></em></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Publicly Accessible</li>
<li>Open / Self-Service Access</li>
<li>Read and Write Capabilities</li>
<li>Data Openly Licensed</li>
<li>Interface Openly Licensed</li>
</ul>
<p>Those seem like a few of the obvious ones, what else am I missing?  Many companies are actively using the term "open API", when they should be using the term "public API".</p>
<p>I think many companies could easily make the choice to truly be open, but choose to just use it as a marketing term, rather than in a literal sense.</p>
<p>Let's call APIs what they are really are, "public APIs".</p>
