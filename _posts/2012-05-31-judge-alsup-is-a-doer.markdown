<p>In the API space we&rsquo;ve all been following the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/google-schmidt-page-damages/">Oracle vs. Google trial</a>.  If you want the real info, go checkout <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/author/caleb_garling/">Caleb Garling&rsquo;s coverage of the trial</a>, he&rsquo;s the blogger who deserves the linkage.</p>
<p>Today the judge in the case, <a title="Judge William Alsup ruled that Oracle does not have the exclusive rights to the structure, sequence, and organization the 37 Java APIS" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/oracle-google-judge-dismiss/">Judge William Alsup ruled that Oracle does not have the exclusive rights to the structure, sequence, and organization the 37 Java APIS</a> in question.</p>
<p>Its great to see this ruling, but I think the real story is Judge Alsup.  To borrow from <a title="Jeff Lawson of Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/company">Jeff Lawson of Twilio</a>, Judge William Alsup is a Do-er.</p>
<p>Alsup didn&rsquo;t just preside over a very important case, he did what was necessary to fully understand what is at stake, and learned to be a programmer.  According to Caleb Garling:</p>
<blockquote><em>Judge Alsup told the court he had learned to code in Java for the trial &mdash; implying that he knew other languages as well &mdash; and he said that he had written some of the infringing code at least a hundred times since Oracle filed its suit in August 2010.</em></blockquote>
<p>I would categorize this as do-er.  According to Twilio, here is the definition of a do-er.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><a title="Do-er" href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">Do-er</a></strong> (n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.</em></p>
<p>Even though what Alsup has done was legal, he was driven to fully understand the situation, picked up the tool (Java), and built an important legal precedent, for us all to benefit from.</p>
<p>When it comes to electing public officials, including judges from the local to federal level, we should be hiring more do-ers, to make sure those who are working to define how our country operates, will go the distance necessary to make sure innovation is protected.</p>
