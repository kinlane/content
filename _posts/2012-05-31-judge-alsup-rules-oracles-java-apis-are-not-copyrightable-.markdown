<p><a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120531173633275">Juddge Alsup finally came in with an official ruling</a> on whether or not APIs are copyrightable:</p>
<blockquote><em>The overall name tree, of course, has creative elements but it is also a precise command structure &mdash; a utilitarian and functional set of symbols, each to carry out a pre-assigned function. This command structure is a system or method of operation under Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act and, therefore, cannot be copyrighted. Duplication of the command structure is necessary for interoperability.</em></blockquote>
