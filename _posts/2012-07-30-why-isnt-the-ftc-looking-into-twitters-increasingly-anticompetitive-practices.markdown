<p>Twitter is really working overtime lately, <a title="actively making developers nervous about the future" href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience">actively making the Twitter ecosystem nervous about the future</a>, cutting off the access of high profile integrations like <a title="LinkedIN" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120629/twitter-cuts-off-linkedin-whos-next/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/07/30/twitter-has-begun-to-cut-off-instagram/">Instagram</a>, including <a title="speculation that Flipboard is next" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120629/twitter-cuts-off-linkedin-whos-next/">speculation that Flipboard is next</a>. To continue with this trend, <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/status/230098997010911233">Twitter just announced $Cashtags</a>, which make makes ticker symbols clickable and searchable on the Twitter platform--which,<a href="http://howardlindzon.com/the-twitter-hijacking-of-stocktwits-the-cashtag/"> according to Howard Lindzon</a>, is a &ldquo;blatant hijacking&rdquo; of his long-time ecosystem application <a title="Stocktwits" href="http://stocktwits.com/">StockTwits</a>.</p>
<p>With this recent behavior, it feels like Twitter has actively gone to battle with the open API ecosystem it gave birth to.  As I watch the Twitter ecosystem battle escalate, I&rsquo;m reminded of Microsoft&rsquo;s behavior in the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft">United States v. Microsoft</a> case, where Microsoft was charged with abusing its monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers.  According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><em> The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system.   Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>It was further alleged that this restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera) that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Underlying these disputes were questions over whether Microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces (APIs) to favor Internet Explorer over third party web browsers, Microsoft's conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and Microsoft's intent in its course of conduct.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can really start drawing some parallels between Microsoft and Twitter.  Twitter is actively abusing it&rsquo;s monopoly power in the microblogging space.  Sure there are other tools you can use, but there were other operating systems too.  The Twitter API ecosystem is not an operating system, but it is a similar open platform, allowing 3rd party developers to integrate applications into Twitter--it just runs in the cloud rather than on the desktop.</p>
<p><a title="Access to the Twitter API is not equal for everyone" href="/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Access to the Twitter API is not equal for everyone</a>, and clearly rate limits are not just about keeping things stable, they are about limiting control for businesses who have not formed licensing or &ldquo;firehose&rdquo; agreements with Twitter.  Since there is no transparency into what these agreements look like, there is no way of telling just how restrictive these <a title="firehose business partnerships" href="/2012/07/12/the-twitter-firehose/">firehose business partnerships</a> might be.</p>
<p>I only support government intervention when things have gone beyond what market forces can handle, and I feel the Twitter situation has gotten to this point.  Twitter has actively touted itself as an open platform from the beginning, while also shrouding itself as a free speech platform for the world.  Over the last two years, Twitter is increasingly displaying anti-competitive behavior towards developers who are working to build businesses within the Twitter ecosystem, actively saying one thing to encourage developers, then turning around and doing something else--misleading the ecosystem community then delivering its own version of features originally built by 3rd parties, and abusing its power through leveraging existing partners, and slowly suffocating competitors through rate limiting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the <a title="FTC" href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/30/technology/ftc_twitter_investigation/index.htm">FTC hasn&rsquo;t opened a new probe</a>, looking into the way <a title="Twitter is handling the business of its API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter is handling the business of its API</a>. I think its because there isn&rsquo;t a big plaintiff like Netscape.  However with the growing number of developers being burned, I predict more companies will be willing to step up, and challenge Twitter in the coming months.</p>
