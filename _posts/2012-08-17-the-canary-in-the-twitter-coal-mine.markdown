<p>I signed up for Twitter in May, 2007.  The Twitter API is what caught my attention all those years ago, but I saw the value of the entire network early on, and I was hooked. &nbsp;I was obsessed with the rising social networking platform and I started a company called <a title="Social Media Squad" href="http://web20squad.blogspot.com/">Social Media Squad</a>--which despite being bootstrapped and employing 20+ people in 2008, ended up being a victim of the economic downturn, and I shuttered the startup.</p>
<p>During this time, I watched the Twitter API fuel much of the platform's early growth, with developers innovating in ways that had never been seen before.  Even with all this innovation, Twitter didn&rsquo;t really start taking off until the concept of social media marketing was established--then really went into overdrive when journalist power users took to Twitter and brought the social media platform to the masses.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developers laid the base, social media marketers generated critical mass and journalists brought Twitter to the world.   This happened during 2007 through 2009, before the first ominous signs emerged, when Tim O&rsquo;Reilly asked questions about the potential of Twitter competing with it&rsquo;s ecosystem during <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5jXcgZnEa0">Web 2.0 Summit 2009</a>--but continued even when Twitter first began to derail in early <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/01/offical-twitter-developer-conference.html">2010 at their Chirp Developer Conference</a>, after the acquisition of Tweetie.</p>
<p>For the last two years, since Chirp, developers have been on the front lines of the Twitter assault on the ecosystem, but much like the upward trend of Twitter--it&rsquo;s escalating, not just because of developers, but because leading journalists and social media marketers are getting scared too.</p>

<p>The Twitter ecosystem is not just made up of developers, it&rsquo;s real impact comes from the power users--developers are the base, but social media and journalism are the voice of Twitter.  We are seeing the <a href="/admin/blog/recent moves by Twitter go beyond just the developer community, and affecting the power users">recent moves by Twitter go beyond just the developer community, and affecting these power users</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve voiced strong support for Twitter as a platform, with equal opposition to their <a href="/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">increasingly hostile stance towards the ecosystem</a> over the last two years.  It&rsquo;s not too late Twitter, but it soon will be, if you guys don&rsquo;t take some corrective action and work to mend fences--not just with developers but with the end users that matter the most, the social media mavens and most savvy journalists who are the voice of the Twitter platform.</p>
