<h2>Rank API Developers Who Authenticate Using Github</h2>
<p>After an API consumer has logged in using Github, it is easy to rank them based upon multiple criteria, that can feed into your API evangelism, and community outreach efforts. &nbsp;Every API provider wants to be as efficient with their community support as possible, and providing a way to rank developers and API consumers can be extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Just like Facebook and Twitter usage can provide insight into every day Internet users, Github can provide some excellent intelligence into who a developer is. &nbsp;Github provides a couple pretty distinct signals for immediately evaluating a new or existing API developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Repositories</li>
<li>Number of Repositories They Are Following</li>
<li>Number of Followers</li>
<li>Quantity of Commits Across Repositories</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple of signals available via Github, that can be used to rank users. &nbsp;Further criteria like programming languages, number of forks and followers on individual repositories can provide even more depth to a ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>Ranking API developers using Github can provide insight into what type of user is signing up and consuming your API, allowing you to possibly take different courses of action based upon a developers overall activity levels on Github. It is likely if a developer is active on Github, they will be active in an API community and are more likely to achieve integration.</p>
<p>Much like social media ranking algorithms are being developed for popular platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Github provides significant signals that any API provider should be putting to use and monitoring.</p>
