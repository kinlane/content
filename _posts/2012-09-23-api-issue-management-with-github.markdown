<h2>API Issue Management With Github</h2>
<p>One use of Github, that is built around one of the core features Github is famous for introducing to the Git process, is as an API issue<a title="API issue management" href="../../buildingblocks/ticket_system.php"> </a>management tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.</p>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.</p>
<p>Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper road-map integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.</p>
<p>Github has done an amazing job of making code management a community effort, it can lend a hand in making management of an API community very similar. &nbsp;Issues around an API, are easily reported, managed and closed using Github.</p>
