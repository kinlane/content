<p>I&rsquo;m continuing my research into how various cities operate their developer meetups, with a focus on mobile developer gatherings.  Today I&rsquo;m focusing on New York City, a town that is fast becoming a contender with Silicon Valley for developer talent.</p>
<p>I went through the meetups for New York City and found the following mobile developer meetup groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

</ul>
<p>While New York does not have the volume of members that San Francisco has, it is definitely a close second.  I also notice that NYC has a couple more workshop, learning based meetups--which tells me the community identifies the need for ramping up new mobile developers, which seems crucial.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the patterns seem similar to San Francisco.  I&rsquo;m not sure if this is because it is the model that works, or if NYC is emulating San Francisco.  Only the data will tell.</p>
<p>More to come...</p>
