<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.</p>
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted. Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Github provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called Gists. You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.</p>
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to HTML tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside Github API SDK repositories.</p>
