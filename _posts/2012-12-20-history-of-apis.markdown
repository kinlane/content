title: 'History of APIs'

<h2>History</h2>
<p>History is everything.&nbsp; Understanding where we have come from is critical to knowing where we are going. While pushing forward with the latest technology, it is always healthy to pause and take a look at that past--so let's take a look at the history of APIs.</p>
<p>Through a technological lense, APIs are just one piece of what the enterprise would call a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). APIs are nothing new. But sometime around 2000, a portion of the SOA experiment left the enterprise and found a more fertile environment in the world of start-ups.</p>
<p>Where we stand in 2013, there are some obvious technical reasons of why web APIs are finding success in companies of all shapes and sizes, and even within government; but not all the reasons for this success is technical. There are many other, less obvious aspects of web APis that have significantly contributed to their success, things we can only learn by closely studying the past and looking at why some of the pioneers of web APIs were successful.</p>
<p>In 2013, we need to make sure we emulate the best practices that have been established over the last 13 years, and not ignore some of the critical variables that contribute to the success of early API providers like Amazon, SalesForce, Ebay and Twitter--much of what is still working in 2013.</p>
<p>When we look back, we can begin see some clear patterns emerge that have defined the industry.&nbsp; Patterns that need to be emulated, and some that should be avoided.</p>
