<p>I&rsquo;m working through the 2012 year,&nbsp;<a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">trying to quantify what I did over the year</a>. It&rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds. One area I&rsquo;m having trouble quantifying is how much programming I do.</p>
<p>Programming is an essential variable in my happiness algorithm. If I&rsquo;m not programming a certain amount each week on projects, I can get very grumpy. ;(</p>
<p>There is an easy way to track how many projects or side projects I&rsquo;m working on, and how much programming time each of these projects get--using&nbsp;<a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a>. The problem is I still don&rsquo;t use Github 100% of the time. I still code many side projects in the doldrums of my Amazon EC2 server(s).</p>
<p>So in 2013, I am going to make Github repositories default for all side projects. Each project will start off as a repository, then I will enhance using:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Github Pages</strong> - Running a static site framework on Github, with subdomain</li>
<li><strong>Jekyll</strong> - Pages and blogs for each project running using Github Pages</li>
<li><strong>Disqus</strong> - Open up casual commenting on each project</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project will be open source by default and allow for interaction and collaboration at two levels using Disqus or Github.</p>
<p>Anyone can easily leave a comment with Disqus or fork the project and commit at a deeper level.</p>
<p>All of my projects will be open by default, and can easily be linked off any of my main websites and blogs.</p>
<p>Additionally I will be able to track the number of side projects I work on, how active each one is, and how much code I commit any given day, week, month or throughout the year.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t easily quantity how much time I programmed in 2012, in 2013 I will have the data necessary, with just a simple shift in how I manage myself.</p>
