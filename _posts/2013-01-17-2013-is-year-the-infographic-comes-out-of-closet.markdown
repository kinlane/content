title: '2013 Is Year The Infographic Comes Out of Closet'
---
<p>Could have asked for better timing between a link from Audrey and email from Visually. &nbsp;Such an important message I want to share in 2013. &nbsp;I will be making this a theme.</p>

<p>Please be responsible with your Infographic creation in 2013, and make sure and check your sources and provide the data behind.</p>
<p>I predict in 2013 we will see more infographics with actual data behind them, but like with <a href="/2013/01/17/the-guardian-is-brilliant-in-supporting-relevant-events-with-open-data/">data journalism at The Guardian</a>.</p>
