<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/16/helicopters-fly-over-london-data" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guardian/Guardian-Helicopter-Data-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of what <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">The Guardian is doing with their data and API strategy</a>.  I think they are a model for what old media should be doing around the globe.</p>
<p>When they post stories, I tend to take a look, not because of the story, but their data driven approach to reporting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A great example of this, is yesterday's helicopter crash on top of a residential building construction project in London, killing two people and injuring 13 others.</p>
<p>The Guardian provides not just the overview of the story with data visualizations and summary, but of course you can download the data behind.</p>
<p>The process is brilliant, because it rides the waves of popular stories, but also provides valuable data behind--which creates value as well as page views.</p>
<p>Which I think will have a greater long-tail than just page view exhaust.</p>
