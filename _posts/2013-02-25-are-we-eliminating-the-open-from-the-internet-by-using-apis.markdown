title: 'Are We Eliminating The Open From the Internet By Using APIs?'

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I love what I do.  I religiously advocate for the usage of APIs across ALL aspects of our business and personal lives, while also making default throughout government operations.  Most of the time I&rsquo;m confident that if done right, with proper communication and transparency all will be well.  But there are those moments where I ask myself, what the hell am i doing?  Fearing I may do more harm, than good.</p>
<p>I had one of these moments the other day during a demo of an API service provider product, when during the portion showing the number of API calls for any given day, on a specific API endpoint, they showed me I could &ldquo;drill down&rdquo;.  This would show me where any group of calls originated, say by application, then further grouping by individual user of an app, then by individual call, allowing me to open a single API call and view the contents.  Showing me the name, address and phone number of a specific user registration. Ummm. WTF!</p>
<p>Its not like I have seen this before, but where I&rsquo;m from this is called &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet sniffing</a>&rdquo;.  And on the open Internet <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it isn&rsquo;t something you do</span></strong>.  To me this seems much more SOA than API, when it comes to ethics of APIs.</p>
<p>To help further my education in this area, I start looking for more evidence about whether opening the content of web traffic is legal or illegal.  I know it can be done, and I know it is done all the time by employers, schools, organizations, etc.  Obviously it is much more complex, but really it seems the contents of your Internet traffic is lumped in with the contents of your phone calls.  Which in theory should require a warrant to look at, but we all know things are a little muddy since 911.</p>
<p>When looking into this I came across lots of discussion around <a title="net neutrality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">net neutrality</a>, in which privacy is a portion of, but really net neutrality is about whether all web traffic is created equal, and deserves same priority, with only a little bit about the contents of that traffic.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of discussion about why looking inside of web traffic should be acceptable for reasons ranging from <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10463665-38.html">homeland security</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/06/opinion/rushkoff-online-monitoring">copyright protection</a>, to being able to understand the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/how-depressed-people-use-the-internet.html?_r=0">mental health of college students</a>. &nbsp;With it being perfectly acceptable for your workplace to monitor your web traffic, as long as they let you know that they are doing it. When it comes down to the legality of it, its really up to each state to define the rules, with California somewhat leading the pack:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>California's Online Privacy Protection Act requires an operator, defined as a person or entity that collects personally identifiable information from California residents through an Internet Web site or online service for commercial purposes, to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its Web site or online service (which may include mobile apps) and to comply with that policy. The bill, among other things, requires that the privacy policy identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects about individual consumers who use or visit its Web site or online service and third parties with whom the operator may share the information.</em></p>
<p>Both Nevada and Minnesota, require Internet Service Providers to keep private, certain information concerning their customers, unless the customer gives permission to disclose the information. Both states prohibit disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and Internet sites visited.</p>
<p>When it comes to Internet traffic, there appears to just be a thin layer which makes it unethical to read someone&rsquo;s email or Internet traffic, something ISPs are having to adhere to being born out of the telecom industry.  But with the introduction of the cloud and with APIs, we appear to be deviating from this strong past.  One where we respected the privacy of someone&rsquo;s content over the phone or mail network. (as if!)</p>
<p>Even though APIs have found success by using HTTP as transport, I often feel like we are potentially rerouting our personal and business worlds through an evolution of the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/walled_garden.html">walled garden</a>&rdquo; concept, where the information from the websites we visit and the mobile apps we depend, appear to be transported on the open Internet, but in reality is being routed through private pipes where all content is ripe for reading, storage, sharing, transformation and even in some cases stop being ours to own entirely.</p>
<p>If feel like we are at an important intersection.  One where we can keep APIs open with the same life giving oxygen that made the Internet work, or we can choose to do away with privacy, ownership and ultimately value, in the name of making a quick buck.  The only thing that an API service provider is required to before rerouting your business and personal lives, is plainly present you with a terms of use and privacy policy--one that most likely is so complex, you will never read.</p>
<p>I think this post reflects one possible dystopian future, if we do not have the proper conversations around APIs today. With a healthy dialogue and relationship between platforms, their developers and users, guided by sensible terms of use, privacy, data ownership and data retention policies.</p>
