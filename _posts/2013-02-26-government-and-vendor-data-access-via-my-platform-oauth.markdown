title: 'Government and Vendor Data Access Via My Platform OAuth'

<p>I&rsquo;m working through some thoughts from <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, around <a title="OAuth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>.  I just wrote a post asking <a title="which of the three OAuth legs is most important" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/which-of-the-three-oauth-legs-is-the-most-important/">which of the three OAuth legs is most important</a>?  As I work through these thoughts, I&rsquo;m also working through another post about platform transparency reports becoming default.</p>
<p>As a venn diagram between security, privacy and transparency emerges in my mind, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why two important areas of resource access via popular platforms are not housed under the OAuth roof.</p>
<p>When we think of OAuth we consider the three legs being server, client and user, with the client often being a developer.  Seems to me there are two other clients:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Government</strong> - Should government requests for information reside within the realm of my OAuth.  When I login to my Twitter, visit settings &gt; apps, I should see any government requests for information with each agency and the information requested.  Right?</li>
<li><strong>Vendor or Partner</strong> - A company should be required to disclose where any personally identifiable information is shared. &nbsp;Providing me access into where my infformation is sold or shared within a company and its relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to further muddy the OAuth conversation.  Just as I&rsquo;m thinking about how to educate the average user about OAuth, hopefully shifting the power into their hands--I wanted to deeply understand how we can further empower everyone to truly own their data in this increasingly API driven, big data economy.</p>
<p>OAuth isn't just technical. &nbsp;It is something every Internet user needs to understand. &nbsp;We need to get to work educating all three legs of the OAuth chain, about best practices.</p>
