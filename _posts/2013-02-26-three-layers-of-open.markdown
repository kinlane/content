<p>There was a lot of discussion at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> last week about what is open?  Ranging from Steve Klabnik&rsquo;s keynote on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a title="Why Open" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oniWVV2k1Pg">why open</a></strong></span>, to late night, IPA fueled discussions about all the layers and depth of the word &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There was a great post on the <a href="http://api500.com/post/44022221316/what-is-open">API rating agency about what is open</a>, which breaks it down into three main groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access and Authentication</strong> 
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>A developer portal to make it easy to register</li>
<li>API design to make it easy to use</li>
<li>Authentication protocol to access to a data</li>
<li>The business model and the price of the APIkey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Freedom and Re-Usabilty</strong> 
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Having Terms of Service well explained and simple to understand</li>
<li>Letting it hackable with no restrictions to specific use cases </li>
<li>Not to say that you have the right to revoke anybody for any reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Neutrality</strong> 
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Access</li>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Policy, Rate Limits and TOS</li>
<li>Quality of Service Without Tiering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Open is often confused with being publicly available, and the act of launching a technical API public, is by default "open".</p>
<p>When in reality open is much more of a philosophical and ethical debate that can vary widely depending on each APIs perspective and the relationship it has with its community.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://api500.com/post/44022221316/what-is-open">API Rating Agency</a> offers up some important detail, that I will use to help communicate what is open to current and aspiring API providers.  Hopefully we can all find a balance that will keep things healthy.</p>
