<p>I&rsquo;m unpacking all my notes from my time spent at the MIT Media Lab this last weekend. &nbsp;One of the byproducts of hanging out with so many smart people is I end up with all kind of great ideas, and I know better than to think I can do them all myself, so I <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ideas">put my ideas out on the web</a> for anyone to run with.</p>
<p>My project from theHackathon this weekend was <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">#ReclaimYourDomain</a>, which I&rsquo;ll write about in detail separately, but the overall project objective was to educate people about:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Owning Their Own Domain</li>
<li>Taking Control Of Their Cotent</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is focused on empowering people in these areas by providing not just tools, but also education.  I will begin educating people about these concepts by showing them how to start a blog, and move into other service areas later.</p>
<p>One service area that would be further down on my roadmap, but I would like to put the idea out there today, is the concept of a personal legal storage locker for terms of use(TOS), non-disclosure agreements(NDA) and the other common legal arrangements we all encounter with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We all click on those checkboxes, agreeing to the terms of use in the growing number of cloud applications we are depending on everyday.  In my world, I&rsquo;m similarly bombarded with numerous non-disclosure agreements that I&rsquo;m required to sign before most companies will talk to me about their API strategy.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have some sort of application that would help me manage these legal relationships that I enter into every day. &nbsp;This app would also extend to my browser(s) and record a copy of each TOS that I agree to, as well as record any NDA I receive, sign and send back.</p>
<p>My storage locker for these legal agreements would not just keep track of each legal arrangement, but also track when I signed, the company I entered into the agreement with, help me know about any future changes by pushing me updates, and keep me in tune with when the agreement expires.</p>
<p>This is something I would like to have integrated into our vision of <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">#ReclaimYourDomain</a>, but for now it would be awesome if someone would get to work building a central storage system, complete with API, desktop clients and browser plugins. :-)</p>
<p>If we are going to start empowering people to take control of their worlds, the legal layer to all of this will be essential.</p>
