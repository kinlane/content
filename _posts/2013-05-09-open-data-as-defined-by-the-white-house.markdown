<p class="p1">I'm processing my thoughts around the White House&nbsp;<span>Executive Order, and the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Policy</a><span>&nbsp;released today by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget. &nbsp;I'm still trying to understand the impact of this order, but as I'm doing this I thought the definition of "what is open data"is worth sharing as a stand alone post.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Open Data </strong>- For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "open data" refers to publicly available data structured in a way that enables the data to be fully discoverable and usable by end users. In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles:</em></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Public</strong> - Consistent with OMB's Open Government Directive, agencies must adopt a presumption in&nbsp;favor of openness to the extent pennitted by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or&nbsp;other valid restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong> - Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open fonnats that can be&nbsp;retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are&nbsp;reasonably structured to allow automated processing). Open data structures do not discriminate&nbsp;against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for&nbsp;the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the&nbsp;extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no&nbsp;restrictions should be placed upon their use.</li>
<li><strong>Described</strong> - Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to&nbsp;understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how&nbsp;to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that&nbsp;describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable,&nbsp;additional descriptions of the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics&nbsp;of the sample, and the method of data collection.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable</strong> - Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> - Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest&nbsp;possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived&nbsp;or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data.</li>
<li><strong>Timely</strong> - Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs.</li>
<li><strong>Managed Post-Release </strong>- A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond&nbsp;to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these are some pretty solid bullet points for defining open data, whether you are a government agency, enterprise corporation or small startup. There are some pretty basic concepts at play here. &nbsp;But concepts that can have HUGE impact in how we operate as a society and a global marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
