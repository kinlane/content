<h2>An Open Source Code Catalog for your API</h2>
<p>Managing code sample, libraries and full blown SDKs with Github are becoming standard uses of Github for API providers. In the area of code management, there is another example of code management for APIs, using Github. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This time the example comes from the Government, rather than the private tech sector. The GSA's&nbsp;<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> has launched the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/">Mobile Code Catalog</a>, an open source catalog of web and native applications that government agencies can use to jump-start their projects. Think application showcase, but all the applications are open source and allow for your API developers to download, fork and re-use code.</p>
<p>The idea of a code catalog is a pretty interesting example to follow, and represents an evolution of several API building blocks--code samples, SDKs, starter kits and application showcase all rolled into one.  Imagine if your API consumers can come into your developer area and not just find code samples, they can find complete applications that they can download, reverse-engineer and put to use.  Talk about going from zero to API integration in as short of time as possible.</p>

<p>Many API owners compete with their ecosystems, by deploying their own version of their mobile, web or desktop apps, but for the others a code catalog is an excellent way to facilitate integrations with your platform. &nbsp;Developers can find complete applications in which they can reverse engineer to deliver their own applications.</p>
<p>Since this approach uses Github to host all applications available via the code catalog, the catalog itself can be downloaded, forked and published anywhere on a public website or private portal. &nbsp;This approach increases the reach of an API, increasing the chances that it will be integrated into new and existing applications.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: always;">In the future there could be hundreds of code catalogs available in the near future, across many business, government and NGO sectors.  While there is money in building proprietary apps on top of APIs, there is even more money to be made when you put meaningful, high quality apps in the hands of end-users.</p>
