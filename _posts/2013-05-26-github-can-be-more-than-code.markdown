<h2>Github Can Be More Than Code</h2>
<p>Github is much, much more than code. People around the globe have been using Github to manage code for several years now, but in the last year we are seeing more people using Github for a variety of projects that don't always have code involved--examples ranging from hosting slide decks for conference talks to repositories for&nbsp;research projects.</p>
<p>There are several very high profile examples of Github being used for open data and API initiatives:</p>

<p>Github lends itself to managing markup and markdown documents in a very collaborative way, allowing for tracking issues and revisions along the way.  There is something about the open source process that introduces transparency and visibility into the document creation and management process.</p>
<p style="page-break-after: always;">Github won't work for all API providers, but for others it can provide a fertile approach to engaging and interacting with your API community while also injecting transparency into how your API, and your business operates.</p>
