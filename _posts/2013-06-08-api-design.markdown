<h2>API Design</h2>
<p>Designing APIs has evolved over the last decade and is becoming a highly skilled craft. APi design is about applying forward thinking about how an API will be used and evolve over time, API deployment and management experience, all of which can go a long way in avoiding common pitfalls and ultimately saving time, money and headache.</p>
<p>In the past, API design was something developers did, and with the emergence of new approaches to API definitions like <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">Mashery I/O Docs</a>, and from service providers like <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">Apiary.io</a>, API design can truly be planned, designed and mocked up to find the most meaningful interfaces possible--before implementation.</p>
<p>Web APIs use URLs, but to find the most meaningful strategy, sensible uses of HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, requires deep consideration about how a resource will be manipulated via a URL, not just retrieved. Then also providing a robust set of parameters and default values that will help make an API intuitive to use.</p>
<p>API design is often done in the trenches of API operations, iterating and perfecting as an API initiative evolves. However with a growing base of API expertise and design tools many API craftsmen are spending time designing the perfect interface before even writing a line of code.</p>
<p>Quality API design is proving to to be one of the best ways to mitigate risk, and help cost effectively execute on an API imitative, wile also delivering the most value to end users.</p>
