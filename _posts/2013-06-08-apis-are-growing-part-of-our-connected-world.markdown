<h2>APIs Are Growing Part Our Connected World</h2>
<p>In 1995 the question was, should we have a website?  By 2000 it was clear, to compete in business you had to have a website.  By 2010 the question was, should we have an API?  And by 2015 it will be mandatory for business to have an API or they won't be able to compete in this new global, API driven landscape.</p>
<p>Our business worlds moved online by 2000, by 2005 things were getting social, then with introduction of cloud computing we were able to start delivering the scalable resources we would need to power the next generation of computing, via mobile smart phones. All of this is made possible by APIs, delivering the modular, valuable resources that are needed to build web, mobile and tablet sites and applications the world demands.</p>
<p>APIs are something that every business owner will have to understand by 2015, and are something that any tech savvy individual can use for business or even personal use. APIs are beginning to connect every day objects to the Internet, making the physical world around us potentially seamless with our personal and professional online worlds.</p>
<p>APIs are being used in almost every business sector to connect them internally, with partners and the public. Our federal, state and city governments are putting APIs to use to better engage with the public.</p>
<p>As API take hold in both our online and offline worlds, they are becoming something everyone needs to be educated on, making sure there is a wide awareness of the pros and cons of API access, and how to take advantage of, and demand the best practices in technology, business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>APIs have left the realm of information technology (IT), and is something that impacts all of us. &nbsp;There is no avoiding it now.</p>
