<p>API pioneers like Ebay, SalesForce, Flickr, Google and Twilio have established this common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.</p>

<p>Some building blocks work best for some providers over others, but these ten building blocks can be considered essential to API deployment and management.</p>
