<h2>What Are APIs Used For?</h2>
<p>APIs are launched primarily to give partners that are outside the company firewall, access to internal data and resources. But recently, APIs are also being used by more of the general public, including non-developers. As APIs' ease-of-use and popularity increases -- and as APIs demonstrate their value and deliver efficiencies -- many companies have begun to consume their own APIs to build internal systems, websites, and mobile apps using the same APIs that they make available to third-party developers and to the public.</p>
<p>APIs are a single endpoint, for programmatic access to a resource, that can be secured and tailored for different uses. APIs originally were used to enable integration with distributed sites and systems by companies like SalesForce, Amazon and Ebay, but newer companies quickly realized APIs would enable new types of relationships, making the web much more social.</p>
<p>Alongside this evolution in API usage, one of the early pioneers Amazon, was working on a new approach to using APIs to deploy infrastructure, now known as Cloud Computing. These APIs have forever changed how we build applications, just in time for a new way to use applications via our mobile phones. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, the number one reason APIs are deployed, is to support mobile development. &nbsp;While APIs can be used for commerce, payments, social, cloud computing and much more, mobile phones and tablets are the biggest driving force for providing APIs and consuming them.</p>
