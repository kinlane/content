<h2>What Are The Benefits of An API</h2>
<p>The most direct benefits of an API are quicker, easier and more re-usable technical access to your companies assets and resources. &nbsp;APIs will allow your company to rapidly develop web, mobile and tablet applications from a single technical stack of machine readable resources. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Using an API, you will be able to take better advantage of outside and 3rd party resources. Giving developers access to only the resources they need to build applications that will be used to expand the reach of a business. It is the perfect balance of opening up access to your resources while also keeping things secure, and within control. This will allow a company to eliminate traditional IT resource bottlenecks, in a sensible way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the technical benefits of an API, an API can bring an entirely new way of thinking to your business operations. &nbsp;APIs will allow you to think differently about your companies most valuable assets and resources, enabling you to decouple them and allow them to be used independently and in new ways you never imagined before. &nbsp;As you take inventory and prepare your resources to be deployed as APIs, it will give you a new way of looking at a way of operating that encourages transparency, interoperability and scalability by default, without costing you security.</p>
<p>This will ultimately transform business operations more agile, nimble and flexible and able to take on any challenge in this new digital economy. &nbsp;</p>
