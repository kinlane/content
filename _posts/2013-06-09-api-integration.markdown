<h2>API Integration</h2>
<p>Integrating with a single API can be tough, let alone multiple APIs. API integration involves on-boarding, exploration, education, authentication, code samples, testing, monitoring and sandboxing. An average API integration project involves everything between the discovery of APIs and when the application goes into production.</p>
<p>As the average web or mobile application evolves from using one or two APIs, to potential 10 or 20, the need to escalate and streamline the integration will become critical. Developers are already feeling the pain, and a new breed of API integration services and tools are emerging to meet the demand.</p>
<p>This new breed of API service providers are looking to aid developers in finding the best of breed APIs, learn about how they work, and get up and running as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Once a developer has successfully integrated with API resources, there is a transition from integration to operation, and a whole other opportunity to provide tools and services that will ensure success for developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API integration has moved beyond the hobby mashup and the challenges of single API integration, and is becoming about building essential applications around mission critical, API driven resources that reside internally, via partner systems and across the Internet.</p>
