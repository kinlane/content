<h2>API Design Tools</h2>
<p>There are many new tools emerging from the API design work going on across the API sector in 2014. Right now, many of these API tools seem to be focused on generating API definitions in various formats, including JSON, YAML and Markdown, with a focus on API deployment, manageent, and more recently integration and discovery.</p>
<p>Generally these tools are open source repositories, that are stored at Github. My goal is to empower you, the API provider or consumer, with the resource you will nee to grow and evolve your API design strategy.</p>
<p>I tend to organize any interesting tools I find under a single umbrella, but as I start to see common patterns, I will break them out into separate groups--such as with the API design editors listed below.</p>
