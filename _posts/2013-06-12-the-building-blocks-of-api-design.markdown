title: 'The Building Blocks of API Design'

<h2>Building Blocks of API Design</h2>
<p>When I look at all of the current companies who are developing services and tools for the API design space, I begin to see certain building blocks emerge, providing a kind of common blueprint for quantitying the world of API design. My goal is to help understand what features, tools, and services these companies are delivering, but also which ones API designers are demanding and actually putting to use.</p>
<p>The goal of this research, is to identify common building blocks that can help new, as well as advanced API providers, understand the different approaches to API design, while not making any assumption on which is best, just shed light on what is available, and maybe a look into the pros and cons, and how each of the solutions fit into the bigger world of API design.</p>
<p>Building blocks are about assembling API design concepts into modular, bit-size chunks, in an effort to educate and prepare you, for your own API design efforts. Keeping in line with where I see API design headed, my list of building blocks, naturallys starts with machine readable API definitions.</p>
