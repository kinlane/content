<h2>Common Building Blocks of API Deployment</h2>
<p>There are a handful of common building blocks involved with API deployment.&nbsp; Depending on the resources you desire to open up access to, different building blocks will be needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These building blocks have been gathered from evaluating many public API providers, tools that have been developed by experienced API developers, and the services being offered and evolved by API service providers.</p>
<p>These building blocks are meant to be generic, modular concepts that will help on-board business or even technical folks to the expanding world of API deployment--something that historically was something IT or developer staff was aware of, but now business leaders from all disciplines need to be aware of.</p>
