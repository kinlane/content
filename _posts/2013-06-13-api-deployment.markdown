<h2>Overview of API Deployment</h2>
<p>Until recently API deployment was just part of API management. You either had the resources to deploy APIs or you didn't. Companies, organizations and individuals usually fall into two categories when it comes to API deployment: 1) Ready to go, just add the right tools, processes and resources then go 2) Need to education, explore and learn--then experiment, iterate and learn, hopefully without incurring a lot of expense.</p>
<p>This research largely reflects the three types of typical API deployments, either bootstrap, DIY approach using API frameworks and internal or 3rd party resources, you are a larger enterprise, or the new breed of cloud API service providers. The goal of this research is to help myself, and you the reader be more informed on the high level concepts at play with API deployment, before making an investment.</p>
<p>I wanted to provide business and organizational leaders with the overall knowledge they need to understand the different possible paths to API deployment.&nbsp; Whether you choose to bootstrap the initiative or look for an API management service provider to assist, this project is meant to get you up to speed, with a healthy awareness of the overall space--from a 100K view.</p>
<p>This paper will walk you through a handful of the common building blocks of API deployment, some frameworks that can be used to bootstrap DIY API deployments, then introduce you to the emerging breed of cloud API deployment, as well as the established API gateway providers.</p>
<p>After reviewing this API deployment project you should be understand the overview of API deployment and ready to think about API management.&nbsp;</p>
