<h2>Using API Gateways for Deployment</h2>
<p>I'm counting seven separate, enterprise quality gateways currently available on the market.&nbsp; It can be tough to understand the features each gateway offers, and often their abilities to act as mediators between the enterprise resources and their consumers.&nbsp; But API gateways are a powerful and complete way to address API deployment, and if this route makes sense for your company, you should reach out to the providers that speak to your companies goals.</p>
<p>All of these API gateways have kept with the times, evolving from their SOA roots, understanding the importance of delivering RESTful APIs, and providing lightweight JSON from a variety of existing legacy, internal resources.</p>
<p>API Gateways are the API deployment option for larger businesses, ones that have volumes of existing resources to expose.&nbsp; Deploying individual APIs with frameworks, and hand-rolling your own management tools can quickly become overwhelming, and these providers have hardened their offerings, making them a solid option.</p>
