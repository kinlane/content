<h2>Cloud API Deployment Platforms</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has been a reality for six years now. While APIs were essential to the development of cloud computing itself, it is natural for companies to offer API deployment services that run exclusively in the cloud.</p>
<p>A handful of companies have emerged in the last year providing API Deployment as a Service, connecting existing and new data sources, then generating web APIs, complete with common API management services.</p>
<p>Cloud API deployment from common data sources will make API deploy accessible to the masses, making API deployment of numerous resources easier for developers, while also making API deployment something a non-developer can handle.</p>
