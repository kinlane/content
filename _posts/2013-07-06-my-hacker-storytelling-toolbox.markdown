<p>I'm working with a variety of tools and services to keep up with my daily research, curation, analysis and ultimately publishing of stories from the world of APIs.</p>
<p>Over the last six months I've migrated to an approach I've called <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>. My goal is to efficiently discover, organize and publish as many meaningful stories around the best practices in the business of APIs, as I can, while encouraging the widest possible distribution as I can.</p>
<p>Hacker Storytelling currently centers around publishing of micro project sites as Github repositories using a simple, blog-aware, static site generator called <a title="Jekyll" href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a>.  You can do a lot of storytelling with static markup or markdown via pages and chronological blog posts.</p>
<p>Even with pages and blogs, I need more fuel for my stories.  I use <a title="Mustache" href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> + <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> to display everything from simple bulleted or numbered lists, t company and tool listings. Mustache allows me to maintain a central data store, which I use as efficiently as I can across all the stories I tell.</p>
<p>To help me acquire this data, <a title="I depend on multiple APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on multiple APIs</a>, but when it comes down to it, a lot of my data is harvested or scraped. To manage my harvesting I use <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">ScraperWiki</a>, to acquire, cleanup and deliver in a structured data in a JSON format. I maintain a vast archive of data as JSON files, across multiple Github repositories where I use <a title="JSON Editor Online" href="http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/">JSON Editor Online</a> to edit in a quick and dirty way. Adding the essential, human element to my curation algorithm.</p>
<p>In addition to my projects, I do a lot of speaking. I have a standard approach to <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/">publishing content from my central content and data stores as presentations</a>. Each conference keynote or session I do, as well as presentations for meet ups, hackathons or even internally at various companies is centered around a presentation i custom build at the moemnt of delivery.  I use either <a title="deck.js" href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> or <a title="reveal.js" href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a> for my presentation delivery tool, as opposed to a classic Powerpoint or newer Google Presentation.</p>
<p>Once I create static pages, blog posts and presentations using content and data I've curated and written, I need a place to put it.  I usually start with a <a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a> repository, using Git as the central project management platform. After that, if I want a project to have a public life, I will publish to the web using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, depending on my goals around the project.</p>
<p>You can find a list of services and tools I'm currently using on the <a title="Hacker Storytelling Toolbox" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/toolbox.html">Hacker Storytelling Toolbox</a> page. I will keep it up to date as I find new tools and services. If there is anything you think I should consider, that contributes to your own storytelling process, please let me know.</p>
