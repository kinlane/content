<p>One topic that drives a lot of pageviews and discussions on a blog post, is sunsetting or deprecation of an API.  I&rsquo;ve written a lot about this with <a title="APIs Are Forever, Wait No...They Can Go Away at Any Time!!!" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/04/20/apis-are-forever,-wait-no...they-can-go-away-at-any-time/">APIs Are Forever, Wait No...They Can Go Away at Any Time!!!</a> and <a title="Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to write another post on this, in hopes of understanding it a little more and generating discussion, and of course be somewhat of a pageview whore.</p>
<p>When it comes to deprecating an API, from the perspective of the API owner, what can they do to alleviate the pain of the API going away:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Never Deprecate an API</strong> - Support the grandchildren of your current developers, creating an API dynasty.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation Policy or SLA</strong> - Set expectations with developers through a deprecation policy, and service level agreements (SLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of an industry or API developer community:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Develop Industry Standard</strong> - If an API is so important, come together and establish an industry wide standard for the space, so anyone can play.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Unified APIs </strong>- Establish a federated or centralized bridge between multiple APIs such as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/04/28/a-unified-approach-to-delivering-apis/">DeltaCloud has done for cloud storage or WindSoc has done for social</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can count on API owners never deprecating an API or always having SLA and depreciation policies, and I&rsquo;m not sure if <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/02/unified-apis-or-api-standards-the-race-is-on/">API standards or unified APIs will win out</a>.  So my suggestion is encouraging API owners to open source their API upon deprecation.</p>
<p>Open sourcing a deprecated API, would allow anyone to step in, and run with the API either taking in a new direction and / or supporting the existing customer base and opportunity. One example of this was when <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/open-source/indextank-now-open-source">LinkedIn acquired IndexTank, then open-sourced the core technology</a> enabling other companies to step in and support existing API developers and take advantage of the indexing technology.</p>
<p>Even beyond supporting existing API developers, open sourcing a deprecated API would establish an &ldquo;open&rdquo; precedent for a technology, and even upon the demise of its parent company, would prevent copyright and patent trolls from buying up legacy companies, only with the goal of stifling innovation.</p>
<p>So consider adding an open-source clause to your API deprecation policy.</p>
