<p><a title="Prose.io" href="http://prose.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/prose-io/prose-io-login.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you haven't use <a title="Prose.io" href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, for editing of markup and markdown content in your Github repositories, I highly recommend it.  Prose.io provides a dead simple editor for content, which works very will for managing static page or blog content stored in a Github repository, and made public using Github Pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Prose.io to easily manage content across many projects I maintain.  I like the concept of a dead simple editor that connects to Github using oAuth and assists me in managing repositories of information.</p>
<p>I would like to see a similar app, but instead of markup and markdown it is for simple management of data, allowing me to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Import / Export Spreadsheet</li>
<li>Import / Export CSV</li>
<li>Import / Export TSV</li>
<li>Import / Export from Google Spreadsheet</li>
</ul>
<p>This application could provide a simple visual table editor for working with smaller data sets, allowing users to get the data in, via a preferred format as well as export in a similiar desired format. Allowing editing in a common table format in between import and export.</p>
<p>Even though I have been working as a database administrator for over 20 years, I have found myself working with simple JSON, CSV data sets that are stored in repositories lately.  Having a dead simple, web-based data editor would go along way in supporting the open data movement.</p>
<p>Dateditor.io is available, and would make a nice addition to my <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> toolbox. I wish I had more time, I would build myself, but I am happy to help support someone else running with as an open source tool.</p>
