<h1>API Management Providers</h1>
<p>Web API management as a service has been going on for over six years now, and combined with the wealth of SOA experience amongst the providers you can be pretty sure that the companies who have been in the business for a while, know what they are doing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first wave of API experience comes out of the enterprise, but quickly a new breed of web API focused companies emerge who redefined the way you manage APis, with an emphasis on open and public. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2014, there are over 20 API management providers ranging from the classic enterprise focus, to data to API solutions in the cloud. While there are differences between these providers, they all have a great deal of experience in planning and execution of API management for a wide variety of API resources.</p>
