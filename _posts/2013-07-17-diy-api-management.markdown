<h1>DIY API Management</h1>
<p>Tackling API management on your own is a realistic strategy. There are many companies and even individuals who manage one or many APIs by designing and deploying their own interfaces and cobbling together a management platform using common cloud services and open sources tools.</p>
<p>While a robust, API portal, complete with service composition, billing, analytics and other tools is optimal, a DIY approach is a cost effective approach that can get you to proof of concept and production without added costs of software and contracts.</p>
<p>It can be very difficult to anticipate what will happen in the deployment and operations of an API. While you can establish a base strategy for your API, most iniatives are real-time research and development around business data and resources, something a DIY approach is well suited for.</p>
<p>API service providers tend to focus on delivering tools for you to secure, manage developers, analytics and billing solutions. These are all very valuable tools for any API provider, so make sure and consider using one of the providers alongside a DIY approach. It is not necessarily a DIY vs. API management service provider question.</p>
<p>There are numerous tools and services that can be used to augment your API management. This paper focus on a handful that are used by existing API providers and augment proven approaches to API management very nicely.</p>
