<h1>Status</h1>
<p>Providing a status dashboard for an API is critical in building trust and goodwill within an API community. Beyond providing communication and much needed awarenes amongst users, a status dashboard provides a very public bar for API operations, stability and reliablity. Something that can go a long way in setting an API apart from the growing number of API driven resources.</p>
