<p>When I read stories like <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/11/18/2960371/walmart-food-drive/">Walmart Holding Canned Food Drive For Its Own Underpaid Employees</a>, I can't help but think about the statement I've heard from numerous conservative friends, that "the market will work itself out".  That somehow markets are this magical force that always will find balance, and work out for everyone.</p>
<p>I think Walmart represents the truth of this statement. The market will work itself out for the merchant class, the rest of us will have to really take care of each other, because markets are about business owners, shareholders and profits.</p>
<p>Unless we begin seeing the light, I think the future will look like Walmart. There will be lots of places to buy the cheap crap we think we need, we won't have healthcare, a living wage, and the environment will be trashed.</p>
<p>Don't worry though! The market will work itself out!</p>
