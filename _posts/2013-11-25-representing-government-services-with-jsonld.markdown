<p>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept of<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/government-services/RepresentingGovernmentServiceswithJSON-LD.pdf">representing government services with JSON-LD</a>.  Using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">civic services schema.org</a> proposal you can represent common government services that target  indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Google the phrase <em>"food bank portland or"</em> and you will see a "card" on the right hand side of the Google search engine results that shows details about the Oregon Food Bank in Portland, OR. This represents trusted, known  information about the public service and renders in a prominent fashion, preventing you from having to look through organic search results to find what you are looking for.</p>
<p>This research project is about exploring what is possible when representing government services using JSON-LD and building tooling that helps average organizations easily generate and publish JSON-LD to represent their own services.</p>
<p>More to come...</p>
