<p>After allowing anyone to generate government services in JSON-LD using a Google Spreadsheet, I wanted to make a simple, web-based form that those without access to Google Apps could use.</p>
<p>Using Bootstrap, JQuery and some other JavaScript goodies, I built a form that when complete will generate a JSON-LD representation. The form possesses all the required fields and has the ability to add multiple audience types and service locations.</p>
<p>I tried to keep the form as simple as possible, assisting users in understanding the various fields, while abstracting away the complexity of the JSON file. When users are done they can select to generate the JSON, copy and paste, then publish anywhere.</p>
<p>If there are any addition fields you need in the form, let me know. If you have any questions you can ping me @kinlane.</p>
