<p>Everyone wants more API users right? So how do you increase the number of accounts you have signed up for your API? You impose rate limits on your accounts, <a title="API relief valve" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">with no relief valve</a>, so that users have to sign up for multiple accounts to get what they need.</p>
<p>Voila!! You can now grow your existing user base 2-5x immediately, without doing any extra work. Now you can boast the number of new registrations and overall registrations you have, and look cool to your bosses and your VC overlords.</p>
<p>Rate limits on APIs are not just about API consumers getting creative, they are often used by API providers to get creative as well. There are many incentives to put rate limits in place that may not seem logical on the surface, and once you scratch a little, you begin to see the other motives.</p>
<p>Of course this isn&rsquo;t something I recommend doing. My motives are simply to educate API providers and consumers about what I see in the API space, and hopefully course correct somewhat, making for a healthier API space based upon numbers that are truly meaningful.</p>
