<p>I get a lot of requests from individuals and companies to partner with them to work on projects. Partnering can range from advising a startup, working on in-kind or paid projects or just having a conversation around a specific topic. Each one of these engagements, I guess you could consider is a sort of interview, for lack of a better description.</p>
<p>Many of these requests never get past email or phone call, but some move forward quickly. I recently had a company who was looking to partner with me on research in a specific area. I got on the phone with the company after brief email exchange, and the conversation started with someone from this company saying, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really looked up much about you, but wanted to talk and learn more.&rdquo;  Immediately the conversation took an interview tone, went on for about 15 minutes and ended. Shortly afterwards I got an email requesting 2 references the company could use.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with interviews or providing work references, I&rsquo;m capable of delivering on both. What I have a problem with is not conducting your due diligence, before getting on a call, and using the legacy interview process as a crutch for your lack of desire to understand who someone is.  If you are going to partner with someone, get to know them. Period.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t Google my name, you are missing out. I&rsquo;m pretty accessible. You can look at my Blogs, Twitter and Github, and get a pretty good understanding of who I am. I&rsquo;m working on over 50+ projects, engaging in active conversations on Twitter, and actively pushing stories and code to my blogs, using Github. I understand that not everyone is like this in their personal and professional lives, but you should be aware enough to look, and be willing to do 15 minutes of Googling&mdash;the minimum viable due diligence these days.</p>
<p>In short, if you are missing all the signals I&rsquo;m putting out daily, we probably aren&rsquo;t a good partnership. I&rsquo;ll decline your request politely, and move on. There is nothing wrong with that, it happens in life all the time. The whole process acts as a great filtration process for me, I just wanted to share with you, so that you can understand. Its not me, its you, or maybe its both of us.</p>
