title: 'Being Social Can Be About Code, Not Just Twitter or Facebook'

<p>I was looking through <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/" target="_blank">VersionEye</a> today, a company that provides a notification system for software libraries. After I was done browsing the site I wanted to sign up and test drive, and when I visited their login page, it spoke my language.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional signup form, VersionEye allows me to signup with the &ldquo;social media account&rdquo; of my choice, giving me the option with oAuth via Github or Bitbucket. I&rsquo;m more Github than Bitbucket, but I like that VersionEye allows me to use either, and they acknowledges that both are &ldquo;social&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I use Github for just as many interactions as I do my Twitter and Facebook. Being social in 2014 is increasingly done via Github and Bitbucket, and often times doesn&rsquo;t directly involve writing or reading of code, but one degree of separation, where we all build the code that drives the world wide web, in a very social way.</p>
<p>Also, a shamless plug: You can easily <a href="https://oauth.io/">create this login for using OAuth.io</a>!</p>
