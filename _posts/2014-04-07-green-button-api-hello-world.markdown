title: 'Green Button API: Hello World'

<p>I was asked to take a look at API efforts around Green Button energy data and see what is possible with its API. As I do with all of my projects, to get going I start a Github repository, publish a Github Pages site, complete with Jekyll to tell the story around my work.</p>
<p>Now that I have the project setup, I just need to get my bearings. What are all the moving parts, what content, data and tools are already in place. Organize everything here in the project repository, then put together a plan of attack.</p>
<p>This Green Button API repository will house everything I discovery and develop as part of this research project, along with the real-time story of my dive into the world of energy data. Use this blog for updates, and I will make sure and link to everything else on the home page and in the main navigation.</p>
