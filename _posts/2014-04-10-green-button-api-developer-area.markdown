<p>There is an existing <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">developer area for the Green Button API</a>, which links you to the sandbox. There are many of the building blocks there that you'd expect to see in a developer area, but it is really disjointed and disconnected from the Green Button API, with a lot of broken links.</p>
<p>I don't see much content or data that is part of this developer area that warrants re-use. Except when you are at the Green Button API sandbox and click around you get at a <a href="https://services.greenbuttondata.org/">seemingly third area</a> that does have stuff that should be re-used.</p>
<p>Most of the links in that third area are broken, but there are <a href="https://services.greenbuttondata.org/sample-data.html">some samples that should be reviewed</a>, and the list of partners is interesting, and worthy documenting.</p>
<p>At this point, I'd say that a fresh developers area for the Green Button API is needed, with a little more UX and master planning, deploying common building blocks that developers are used to, and wrap it around the Green Button API that has already been established.</p>
