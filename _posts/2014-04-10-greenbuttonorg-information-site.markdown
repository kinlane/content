<p><a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">GreenButton.org</a> is a very informational site about the Green Button data iniative. There is a lot of information there about the program, how to get involved if you are a utility, consumer or application developer.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenresources.html">resources page</a> with a lot of valueable links. This looks like the place to go for a background on how we got to where we are at. There is also a Twitter account that is very active, <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenButtonData">@GreenButtonData</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell who is behind GreenButtonData, and there isn't much in the way of timestamps. The most recent data I find is May 2013 on the resource page. I will spend more time here, trying to get a clearer picture of where GreenButton.org fits in.</p>
