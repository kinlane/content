<p>I just <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">went through 52 services that I depend on</a>, and experienced 52 different ways to manage passwords&mdash;most of which sucked! It seems that each service has their own way of allowing you to change your password.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there were UX blueprints that companies could follow when offering standard features like password management. At least it would be nice if developers went and experienced 10-20 password flows within existing leading apps, before designing their own.</p>
<p>In 2014 there are some pretty strong patterns that have emerged for application user experience, I think we just need more places where we can browse and experience the best patterns out there, so we can emulate them when developing our own apps.</p>
