<p>I was recently talking with someone from the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT), <a href="http://www.its.dot.gov/">Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA)</a>, about APIs and automobiles. We had a long talk about reality, innovation, and fantasy colliding in this new world we call the Internet of things (Iot)&mdash;both trying to understand the best path forward.</p>
<p>There is a whole Evernote full of ideas from our discussion, but one thing that was said that really stuck with me was:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>This isn't a mobile phone, we just can&rsquo;t stop, and reboot a vehicle that is flying down the freeway 70 MPG!</em></strong></blockquote>
<p>For me, this statement represents something we should ask ourselves when embarking on every single Iot project, forcing us to think critically about how we are using technology across our everyday lives.</p>
<p>As an Internet technologist, we have enjoyed a freedom to innovate in ways that may not exist in other physical aspects of our lives, such as our cars, our homes, ad our schools, or the workplace--the constraints are different.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s please be critical when we apply Internet technology and APIs into all areas of our lives.</p>
