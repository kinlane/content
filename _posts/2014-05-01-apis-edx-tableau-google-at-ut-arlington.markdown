<p>After I went to <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">Emory University in Atlanta</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/business-of-internal-apis-at-ibm-impact-last-tuesday/">spoke at IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;this week, I attended a one day of a planning session for an edX course at UT Arlington, in Texas.</p>
<p>George Siemens (<a href="https://twitter.com/gsiemens">@gsiemens</a>) invited me out to for the planning session, which included folks edX, Tableau, Google and of course UT Arlington. I gave a <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/edx-ut-arlington/index2.html#/">one hour talk on APIs</a>, a talk I had <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/edx-ut-arlington/index.html">originally prepared to be about APIs in higher education</a>, but after listening to the discussion for a couple hours, I crafted an entirely new talk.</p>
<p>The planning session was called "DesignJam for edX MOOC on Data, Analytics, and Learning&rdquo;--which was all about developing an online course around data and analytics, where pulling information via APIs would play a central role.</p>
<p>Originally I was focused on evolving the <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> platform using APIs, something I will be exploring more after talking with the folks from edX. However, in the end, I focused on how we could teach hundreds, or potentially thousands of students, about using APIs as part of a wider data and analytics class.</p>
<p>The session at UT Arlington ended up being a great experience, thinking about the potential of APIs for edX, what a class about data and analytics using APIs would look like, and a full day of hanging with some really interesting academics, while getting an opportuity to observe the process around planning in this fast growing world of online courses.</p>
<p>Just like with the <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">domain exploration at Emory University</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">experience at IBM Impact in Vegas,</a> I have a lot of notes to process, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more to say about what happened in Texas.</p>
