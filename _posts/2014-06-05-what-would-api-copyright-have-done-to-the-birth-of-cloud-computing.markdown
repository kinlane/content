<p>As I think about the potential impact of the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle v Google case</a> on the future of APIs, I can&rsquo;t help but think about cloud computing, and how API copyright might have affected the development of this critical layer to the Internet--this topic was one of the areas <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">I focused on when sharing information with EFF for the Oracle v Google amicus brief.</a></p>
<p>Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 both began as API interfaces, with an accompanying command line interface (CLI). When S3 and EC2 came onto the scene, it forever changed how we thought about not just computing, but how we provided access to resources, that we need to develop the next generation of apps.</p>
<p>While Amazon has emerged as leader, there are many other successful companies who deliver cloud services, which either completely mimic Amazons approach, or emulate it in various ways. Companies like Rackspace and their open cloud initiative OpenStack, cloud orchestration provider Eucalyptus, and other providers including Google have all crafted their own approaches by re-using the best API design patterns that Amazon has employed.</p>
<p>This whole thing called the cloud, and web APIs were so new, that very few people thought about concepts like copyright on API designs. APIs were about interoperability and when you developed your API you often emulate other APIs in the space that you new and respected. When it came to cloud computing everyone looked to Amazon&rsquo;s lead, and emulated the best patterns available in this new wave of API driven compute resources.</p>
<p>If Amazon had asserted copyright control over the API designs for Amazon S3 and EC2, what would the cloud computing industry look like? Rival companies that were developing interoperability and orchestration tools might have thought twice when it came to designing their own APIs, introducing unnecessary changes in their designs to avoid the legal hassles or monetary costs of licensing the use of Amazon&rsquo;s blueprints.</p>
<p>Of course there is no way of knowing for sure, but cloud computing did not emerge from any top down standard or API definition, it grew organically from reusing the best patterns from the space, and allowing a leader to emerge naturally from the success of the best patterns. I find it hard to believe that cloud computing would have been so adopted by companies if the interoperability, data portability and other features that were possible because of API reuse, weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think about what API copyright might slow or prevent in the future, it might be the next seismic shift like cloud computing that gets suffocated out of existence, because a handful of tech giants don&rsquo;t quite get why this whole API thing is working, and decided to wield API copyright as a competitive advantage.</p>
