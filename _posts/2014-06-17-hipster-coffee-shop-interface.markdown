<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to expand on <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">my restaurant API analogy</a>, to be used when helping people understand the API copyright debate.  A restaurant menu works well to get folks on boarded with the separation between an API definition, its server side, and client side code&mdash;when compared with the restaurant menu and the behind the scenes kitchen.</p>
<p>My expansion this week is from an experience in a hipster coffee shop, while meeting a client in San Francisco. I walked into this small coffee shop, and there was no menu, just a list of beans on a chalkboard, several lines of customers arranged along a counter, with a cash register at the end. Quickly assessing the situation I noticed that each coffee counter line had 5-8 people in them, and the cash register line had nobody in it, so I stepped up there.</p>
<p>The young lady politely asked how she could help me, and I replied "I&rsquo;d like a coffee", in which she replied, "Aweeee you haven&rsquo;t been here before have you?" I nodded NO, as a dark hipster shudder rose up my spine. Oh, this is one of those place I&rsquo;m supposed to be in the know, and just understand how the interface works.</p>
<p>She explained that I needed to pay, go get in line, and the attendee would strain my coffee through cloth. Oh yes, of course!  She abruptly said $4.38 please. Wait, I need a peanut butter cookie too! Ok, $6.88 then.</p>
<p>I shuffled over to the other end of the counter, got in line, and when my turn came, the attendee said in a perky voice, &ldquo;what can I get you&rdquo;? I said again, &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo;! Which she replied, &ldquo;what kind, and how large&rdquo;? At that point, a 3rd clerk jumped in and said &ldquo;we've already made him one&rdquo;, and handed me my coffee. I'm assuming it is the super special, old hippie, non-hipster, secret sauce, clueless customer edition.</p>
<p>While this particular example of a restaurant interface doesn&rsquo;t apply to API copyright, <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">as my previous one did</a>. It does however, show the importance of common interfaces, the confusion that arises when unique interfaces are used, and how important it can be for interfaces to be interoperable and allow for re-use. While I don't think all coffee joints should be like Starbucks, I do think common approaches (like a menu on wall), goes a long ways.</p>
<p>The hipster coffee shop interface scenario also shows the separation between API definition and backend server code for the API. Where a menu should be available as a coffee shop interface definition, but in this case we don't have a definition, or a standard interface. Even with this, I have to say, the coffee was amazingly kick-ass, and one of the best cups of coffee I&rsquo;ve had since I was in Europe, also showing the importance of a quality API implementation, behind the definition.</p>
<p>The confusion I felt when I walked into this hipster coffee shop, was the same confusion when I land on an API developer area, and try to onboard with APIs who don&rsquo;t use common patterns when designing their interfaces, with no API definition and resulting interactive documentation. The API might end up delivering some great value, but the difficulty in understanding this value, and confusion while on-boarding might prevent me from ever realizing an APIs full potential, and integrating into my daily operations.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll find more ways of related APIs to the restaurant experience, and get better at telling these stories, helping people understand the different layers of an API, and reduce the friction in design, deployment, and management of valuable API resources.</p>
