<h2>A New Generation Of API Design</h2>
<p>This is not a story of WSDL or even WADL, this narrative beings in early 2011 with the <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/calling-all-developers-check-out-our-new-developer-site">release of a new Wordnik developer area</a>, which included a new version of the API documentation, that wasn&rsquo;t just the same old static API docs--this time it was being driven by a new API definition format, that Tony Tam from Wordnik would later call Swagger. Wordnik needed a way to keep their documentation up to date, so they created Swagger, a JSON format for describing the Wordnik API, and then built Swagger UI, an automatically generated, interactive documentation for the API.</p>
<p><span>With this one release, Swagger would usher in a new generation of API design, giving us a new way to describe the increasing number of APIs we were developing, and allow us to automatically deliver, interactive documentation that would help consumers understand the value an API delivers. Wordnik didn't stop there, they created tooling for generating server side and client side code, directly from the same Swagger API definitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wordnik had developed Swagger to meet their own needs around designing and maintaing the Wordnik API, but through this process, they also set the stage for a new way to define our APIs, that would give us a &nbsp;a common, machine readable language for discussing and collaborating around our APIs, generating code, documentation, and as time would show, much, much more.</span></p>
