<h2>Internationalization</h2>
<p>As I travel internationally more, evangelizing APIs, I'm seeing an impending collision of API design, the structure, availability, and naming of API resources, emerge. APIs are not just being designed out of Silicon Valley, I am seeing API design conversations spread across Europe, Asia, India, Australia / New Zealand, and South America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internationalizaiton is a new topic I'm researching as part of my API design work, and with the rapid spread of APIs, I'm concerned will become a systemic issue, that will seriously challenge the flourishing API design space. I'm still working to understand the best way to cataog APIs I find in various languages, so there will be more in the next edition of this white paper.</p>
<p>We are still developing languages for describing APIs, and I'm beginning to see tools that help API designers translate between each of the leading API definiton formats. I'm hoping we can start seeing the introduction of tools, that help API designers manage the internationalization of their API designs.</p>
