<h2>Leading API Definition Formats</h2>
<p>In the last couple years, we've seen an emergence of four new machine readable formats, that give us a new way to describe APIs, as well as interact with others throughout the APIs lifecycle. The emerging formats use JSON, Markdown, and YAML to define an API, providing a simple, machine readable blueprint, that API providers and consumers can use a single truth for all API interactions.</p>
<p>I'm also looking at other formats I've come across in the space, and will be adding them to my list as I better understand them, and able to quanity their reach. For now I'll be tracking on the four leading API definition formats.</p>
