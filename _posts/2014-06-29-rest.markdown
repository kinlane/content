<h2>REST</h2>
<p>It would be a mistake to not mention REST in a white paper on API Design. However, this paper is 100K level, and I would consider REST, while part of every aspect of API design, to be more of the 50K level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources available to learn about REST, and how you&nbsp;create, read, update or delete information on the Internet using HTTP--I recommend starting with <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy Fieldings dissertation</a>, then Google the term "REST", and get to work on some of the other valuable information out there.</p>
<p>Even for the non-developers, a fundamental understanding of REST is required to consider yourself an API designer. You can master any of the API definition formats described here, but if you don't grasp REST, and how it employs HTTP, you will struggle in the design of your APIs.</p>
