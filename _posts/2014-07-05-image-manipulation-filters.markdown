<p>When i started working on my <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">imagine manipulation API</a>, I went for the low hanging fruit, and the easy to apply filters from the image library i was using--ImageMagick. I implemented four easy to understand to image filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charcoal</li>
<li>Polaroid</li>
<li>Oil Painting</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another universal filter, called "distrortimage", which has a whole bunch of settings i can apply, but it will take some experimention. My goal is to take common photos, and turn them into line drawings, black and white, and other filters I'd like to use in my storytelling.</p>
<p>As I have time I will play with other filters, but next I need to tackle some more utility APIs that I need in my daily operations.</p>
