<p>Now that I've reached the age of 40, I've learned a lot about myself, how my mind works, what I remember and what I don&rsquo;t. I've also learned a lot about how I'm perceived and remembered by the world around me, both physically and virtually.</p>
<p>I first started a blog in 2006, and it took me about 4 years until I found a voice that mattered. It wasn't just a voice that mattered to readers, it was a voice that mattered to me. If I don't blog about something I found, I don't remember it, resulting in it never happening.</p>
<p>I don't have any examples of this happening, because anything that fell through the cracks, never happened. This is why my public and private domains are so critical, they provide me with my vital recall of facts and information, but also becomes a record of history&mdash;defining what has happened.</p>
<p>How much of history do we retain from written accounts? If we don&rsquo;t write history down, it doesn't happen&mdash;now we generate reality partially through online publishing.</p>
