<p>Mission accomplished! I got the <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json created for the www.usa.gov domain</a>, and the three APIs that I was targeting. One API already had the Swagger API definition created, and another had CORS issues, making each of the APIs a different experience to make a reality.</p>
<p>My end goal was the APis.json, so I can submit all three of these APIs to the <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> search engine. I will have to make a proxy for the <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/mobile-app-gallery-api.html">Mobie App Gallery API</a>, before it will work, and reference my URL in the Swagger specification, instead of the actual API.</p>
<p>Even with the problems, I achieved dmy goal in having machine readable Swagger specifications for all three APIs, and an APIs.json file that reference all the APIs available at www.usa.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoepfully the GSA will take these machine readable specs and put them within their own domain at some point. For now it provides some great lesson in what is possible when it comes to API discovery across the federal government.</p>
