<p>I get a lot of folks who tell me how they love my storytelling across my blog(s), but sometimes they find it hard to keep up with my posting style, emphasizing that on some days I post too much, and they just can't keep up.</p>
<p>Since I just got home from API Craft in Detroit, and have a mind full of ideas, and Evernote full of have baked stories, and I feel a storytelling spree coming on, I figured I'd kick it off by telling the story of why I blog the way I do.</p>
<p>First, I blog for me. These stories are about me better understanding the complex world of APIs, and the storytelling process forces me to distill my thoughts down into smaller, more understandable chunks.</p>
<p>Second, I do not feel I can move on from an idea until it has been set free&mdash;meaning it is published to the site, and tweeted out. Only then can I detach and move on to the next thing on my list. I've tried scheduling, and all of that jive, but they only conflict with my emotional attachment to my stories.</p>
<p>Third, there is an emotional attachment to each one of my stories. This makes my storytelling, about me, not pageviews, SEO, or any other common metric in the blogosphere&mdash;my blogging is about me learning, and sharing these ideas openly with the world, everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>After all of that, my blogs are about you the audience, and helping you understand the world of APIs. I&rsquo;m sorry if my storytelling flow is non-existent some days / weeks, and then overwhelming other days. I leave it up to you to bookmark, and flag for consumption later.</p>
<p>There are some mechanisms built into my network of sites to help you with this process. The blog uses Jekyll, which has a nice next / previous feature on the blog posting, so if you visit the latest blog, you can just hit previous until your head explodes. (I&rsquo;ve seen it, it is messy)</p>
<p>Also all of my curation of stories across the API space, and my analysis eventually trickles down to all my research sites. So anything I read or write about API design, which eventually be published to the <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design research site</a>. So you can just make regular rounds through my core research to catch up on what I read, think and publish&mdash;I do this regularly myself.</p>
<p>This is just a little insight into my madness, and it is just that&mdash;my madness. Welcome to it, and I hope you enjoy.</p>
