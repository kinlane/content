title: 'Explore Using APIs In The Classroom'
---
<p><span>Whether its external, publicly available APIs like Twitter and Flickr, or internal resources like the campus events calendar or student directory, there are opportunities for incorporating APIs into the classroom. Blogs, equipped with RSS have been accepted for some time on campus, and APIs are just the next logical evolution from RSS for aggregating not just content, but data, and other valuable programmatic resources or audio, and media services.</span><br /> <br /> <span>I recently worked with the University of Arlington, in Texas (UTA), and edX, the online education partnership between Harvard and MIT, and other institutions like UTA, on how APIs can be applied in an online data &amp; analytic course. In this scenario, students could be introduced to valuable data resources like US census data, corporate records using OpenCorporates, creative commons pictures from Flickr, or maybe just Twitter data--in a single, online class experience.</span><br /> <br /> <span>There are some interesting opportunities to incorporate both public, and campus API resources into the classroom experience, adding an entirely new dimension to the university API discussion. The skills students will learn by using APIs in the classroom can help increase overall web literacy, and their proficiency in finding what they need to get their homework done, and some day give them an advantage in the workplace as well.</span></p>
