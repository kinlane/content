title: 'External Vendor Access To Services'
---
<p><span>Beyond internal IT, faculty and administrators, and even the students, APIs can securely open up access to valuable campus resources, in a way that allows campus IT to monitor, and shut off access to prevent abuse. While information about university APIs can be public, the APIs are most often secured using &ldquo;API keys&rdquo;, or employs oAuth when personally identifiable information (PII) is being accessed, allowing for students and faculty to have a say in who has acces to their personal information.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>Modern web API management infrastructure allows for the securing, and metering of web APis, which requires any external vendor to first register for access, obtain API keys, before they can access any campus resources. This type of access allows campus IT to easily open up access to outside vendors, while protecting the privacy and security of campus operations&mdash;striking a balance when it comes to building website, web and mobile applications around campus resources.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Take a look at UC Berkeley&rsquo;s developer area to get an idea of what a centralized developer area, with a modern API management platform looks like. UC Berkeley now has a single location to hang any campus API, as well as a single point of entry for internal and external access to campus API resources, with different levels of access if you are student, faculty, or an external vendor being given access to API to build an application, or accomplish a specific systems integration.</span></p>
