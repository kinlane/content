title: 'Investing In Hackathon, Data and Process Jams '
---
<p><span>Universities are following the lead of the tech sectors and employing hackathons to provide a rich, competitive environment for students to learn about pubic, and campus APIs, build websites, web and mobile applications that help them in their classes, support a project, or solve a problem they face in their everyday campus life.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>University of California Berkeley is experimenting with integrating hackathons into courses, as well as campus life. Instructors are playing with the best way to ensure that the intellectual exhaust from each hackathon is captured, and any ideas, code, and other projects have the opportunity to live on as part of the classroom or campus experience. Imagine a world where students help build, and improve on the applications they use to interact with their schools. UC Berkeley has acquired applications from students, setting an interesting new precedent for how campus IT services are delivered, and moving us closer to this vision.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Hackathons are also being employed in an intercollegiate way, allowing schools to compete with each other when it comes to developing applications, much like sports, and other campus activities. Hackathons are a simple format, that is attractive to young students, and can be done very cost effectively, a regular basis, using existing classroom space, and campus catering services.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>Hackathons are also being employed beyond the startup community, and being executed at the industry level in education, healthcare, and energy, as well as within government from city to the federal government. Hacking events provide a great networking opportunity for students, an excellent way to introduce them to new technology, while also potentially developing code, applications, and new process that can improve campus operations, and enrich the education experience</span></p>
