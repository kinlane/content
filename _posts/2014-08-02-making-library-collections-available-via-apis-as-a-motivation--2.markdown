title: 'Making Library Collections Available Via APIs As A Motivation - 2'
---
<p><span>I&rsquo;m hopeful for libraries, on and off campus, playing a leading role in the world of APIs. The core values that make an API initiative successful reflect the same values that come from the library sciences profession and its evolution over the last couple centuries. When it comes to establishing healthy patterns for API usage, I think we will be looking to libraries more and more in the coming years, as some parts of the tech sector appear have less than honorable intentions when it comes to APIs.</span></p>
