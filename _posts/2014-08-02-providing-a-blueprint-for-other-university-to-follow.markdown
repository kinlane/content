title: 'Providing A Blueprint For Other University To Follow'
---
<p><span>My goal with this white paper is to create a static snapshot of the current state of APIs in higher education, share some of what I learned looking through the leading universities in the space, and also apply some of my wider knowledge from the API industry beyond the university campus--in hopes university leaders are listenging.</span><br /> <br /> <span>I want this paper to be a blueprint that any university CIO or CTO, student or energetic professor can pick up, and get an idea of what is going on across other universities when it comes to APIs. I&rsquo;m fascinated by what I&rsquo;m seeing out of BYU, UW, UC Berkeley, and UM, and as I do with the rest of the space, I&rsquo;m looking forward to monitoring their progress, and having more conversations about how we can make university API efforts more successful.</span><br /> <br /> <span>I will continue to update this white paper as I find more examples of institutions putting to APIs to work. While much of this research is rooted in what I'm seeing across these 12 higher education institutions, there is still much that is speculation based on my experience, and as I find more concrete examples in the wild I'll expand and add to this paper.</span></p>
<p>I can't emphasize enough, the important role that higher education will play in not just equipping the next generation with the web literacy skills they will need to be successful, but also help take the lead in defining the underlying pipes that will drive our increasingly digital economy. APIs are not good by default, they can be used is some very bad ways, but I'm confident that if higher education takes a lead in the space, the patterns that can be established will provide a healthier path forward than if we let Silicon Valley continue to exclusively lead.</p>
