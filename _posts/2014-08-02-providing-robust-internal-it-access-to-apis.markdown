title: 'Providing Robust Internal IT Access To APIs'
---
<p><span>Using web services to deliver digital services across campus should be nothing new to seasoned IT personnel. However there will be a learning curve when it comes to the nuances around making the same assets and resources available via web APIs. Traditional IT approaches to deliver web services, and even some web APis are often very technically driven by the view from the IT or developer staff. One of the hallmarks of most leading web APIs, is that they focus delivering digital resources in a way that is closer to what the end-user will actually need, making what is often a very technical resource, much more accessible to a wider audience.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Self-service, secured access for IT staff to all services, across all systems enables a much more flexible, agile, and resilient environment, that eliminates redundancy, and encourages consistency. Modern web APIs use the same infrastructure as websites, so it should not require too much retooling to switch to designing, deploying and managing web APIs from a legacy SOA infrastructure.</span><br /> <br /> <span>In an ideal university API effort, campus IT will take the lead on all aspects of the API program, but IT groups should also be aware, as with other examples of shadow IT, where faculty, administrators and students look to external software services, to meet their needs&mdash;the same can happen with your API program, leaving you with less control than if campus IT took the lead.</span></p>
