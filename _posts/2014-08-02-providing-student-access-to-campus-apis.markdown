title: 'Providing Student Access To Campus APIs'
---
<p><span>The thought of providing direct access to campus digital resources for students will seem like an insane idea to many IT leaders, but in 2014, it is a new generation of delivering information technology and services, and with all entering freshman being born and raised on the Internet, we can know longer exclude them from the flow of campus digital information.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Many students are aware that APIs exist in the platforms they use like Twitter and Instagram, and posses a unique digital literacy that many campus IT staff, and teachers will not have. The energy of each wave of students that pass through an institution needs to be captured, and making campus resources and services available through simple, secure APIs can go a long way to provide the access students will need to find workarounds to frustrating IT systems, and even innovate when building applications and tools that schools do not have the time or resources to do themselves.</span><br /> <br /> <span>Providing access to campus resources for students is a new idea, but one that makes sense in the Internet age, where schools are being required to do more with less, making it unacceptable to not capture the energy of the young, technically savvy students making their way through our universities. in coming years, making APIs available to students will not just be necessary to streamline campus operations, it will be an essential part of preparing students for the workplace they are about to enter, and assert their role in the digital economy, in a way that makes them aware and confident of their digital presence.&nbsp;</span></p>
