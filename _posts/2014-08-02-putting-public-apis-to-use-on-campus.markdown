title: 'Putting Public APIs to Use On Campus'
---
<p><span>APIs within the university are not just about providing access to campus resources, it can be about consuming public APIs like Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr and WordPress in the classroom, or during administrative operations. APIs are designed to be part of the open web, allowing for the development of web, mobile, and single page applications that can span both campus, and public API resources in a single blog post, mobile application, or internal Student Information System(SIS).</span><br /> <br /> <span>The line between internal and external services has blurred with the growth of the Internet, and the websites, web applications, and mobile applications that are used on campus reflect this reality&mdash;there is no reason APIs will be any different. Every outside cloud service that is used on campus should have an accompanying API, allowing for integration with existing systems, as well as feature and data portability for students, faculty, administrators and IT.</span><br /> <br /> <span>It is likely that campus IT has already started organizing outside software and services into a central place for faculty, administrators and students to find, providing a sanctioned list of outside services that can be put to use. IT needs to do the same with the APIs that these services offer--especially if they are not campus owned. APIs are everywhere, whether or not an institution acknowledges them, and it is better to not just take a pro-active stance and make them part of regular activity, or better yet, maybe take a lead and make sure students are not just prepared, but fully equipped for their role in our increasingly digital world.</span></p>
