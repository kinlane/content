title: 'Resorting To A Bottom Up API Strategy'
---
<p><span>In contrast to the top down approach at BYU, you can see a more bottom up, organic approach playing out at UC Berkeley. While there is buy-in for a centralized developer area, and API management platform, the original effort has been led by a small group of faculty, administrators, and students. After building momentum and aggregating a handful of valuable campus APIs, the program has managed to gain momentum, through slowly educating, and including other individuals, programs, and administrators across the UC system.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>A bottom up approach at UC Berkeley is definitely not ideal, but in reality, will probably be how most APIs are introduced on many campuses around the world. It isn&rsquo;t just higher education institutions that are target of this type of bottom up pressure to open up access to digital resources--large companies are feeling industry pressure, and government has been responding to civic pressure for government to be more open and transparent the last couple years.</span><br /> <br /><span>My dream implementation at a university would be both top down, and bottom up. The grassroots evangelism that occurs bottom up is really necessary to get the buy in across a large institution.&nbsp;</span>In our federal government the president mandated that agencies open up their data and resources, but it is taking a grassroots army of evangelists, data stewards, and passionate developers to actually make it a reality on the ground&mdash;this same story will play out across universities over the next couple of years.</p>
