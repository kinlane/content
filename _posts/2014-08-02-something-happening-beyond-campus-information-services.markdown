title: 'Something Happening Beyond Campus Information Services'
---
<p><span>As I was looking through APIs from different universities, I began to notice that campus information technology (IT) were beginning to get organized in how they approached the deployment and management of their APIs, but what really caught my attention was the usage by students as well. While some very progressive IT folks are beginning to understand the benefit of using APIs, and the access and interoperability it can introduce into campus operations, students are also increasingly tech savvy, and are scraping data and content to develop their own API to suppor the apps they build, while also putting pressure on IT to provide more services they can put to use.</span><br /> <br /> <span>All of the activity I was seeing, at a handful of schools, convinced me that I needed to pay closer attention to what universities were up to. I was pleased to also find that half of the universities who were deploying APIs, also had a centralized developer area for their APIs, while the rest of the deployments were singular API efforts, for a specific purpose. I consider the six that have a centralized developer and API strategy, as the leaders when it comes to APIs in higher ed.</span></p>
