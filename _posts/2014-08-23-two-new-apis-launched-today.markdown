title: 'Two new APIs launched today'
---
<hr />Today weâve launched two additions to the Mixcloud API: editing of upload metadata and a Widget Javascript API and weâre looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with. 
First up: editing. For a while now it has been possible to upload via our API (http://www.mixcloud.com/developers/#uploads) but you have only been able to make changes through the website. Now it is possible to change the picture, name, description, tracklist and tags for an upload (whether it was uploaded using the API or not). Check out the documentation here:Â http://www.mixcloud.com/developers/#editing<br /><br />URL: http://blog.mixcloud.com/2014/08/22/two-new-apis-launched-today/<br />
