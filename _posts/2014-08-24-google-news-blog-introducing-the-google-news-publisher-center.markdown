Â Until now, when you made changes to the structure of your site, we might not have discovered them unless you told us. Â And that meant they might not have shown up in Google News, which in turn could have resulted in readers not seeing your great content.

Â Ultimately, our goal is to make this a platform where news publishers and Google News can work together to provide readers with the best, most diverse news on the web.<br /><br />URL: http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/introducing-google-news-publisher-center.html<br />
