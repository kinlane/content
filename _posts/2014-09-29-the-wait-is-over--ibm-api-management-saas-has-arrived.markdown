title: 'The wait is over &ndash; IBM API Management SaaS has arrived!'
---
<hr />We are very pleased to announce the availability today of the IBM API Management Service â a public cloud SaaS offering of IBM API Management!
This offering gives you the opportunity to use the power and flexibility of the IBM API Management product but in a hosted managed service run by IBM on your behalf, freeing you from the need to manage the infrastructure yourself and instead focus on the business services you want to expose.
To enable you to get a feel for this new capability we invite you to sign up for a free 30 day trial through the IBM Cloud Marketplace or simply click the link below and then select âGET /startedâ;
 Benefits of the SaaS offering;
We are really excited about this new stage in the evolution of IBMâs API Management solution, and we look forward to hearing your comments and experiences on platform, whether it be to carry out a pilot using the SaaS offering before you deploy our on-premise offering, or if you are looking to deploy your production workload on the cloud.
New to API Management?
 API Management is a rapidly emerging space in the IT industry which gives you the tools and capabilities to rapidly define, secure, scale and manage APIs in order to provide access to business services in new channels like Mobile. In addition to the technical ability to expose an API it also importantly provides the ability to socialize your API with target communities of application developers, giving them the opportunity to learn about your API and sign up to use them. Finally API Management solutions provide analytics tools for assessing how successfully your APIs are being used so that the business owners can measure the adoption of the APIs.
