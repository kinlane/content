<p><a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/hacker-news-api">Hacker News launched an API today</a>, complete with real-time features. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News was created by Paul Graham in February 2007</a>, and in October 2014 they are launching an API, something that is clearly innovation and forward thinking at work--not.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love me some APIs (if you hand&rsquo;t notice), but waiting seven years to launch your API, as one of the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; technology news sites, ran by one of the &ldquo;leading VC firms&rdquo;, is not something to celebrate.</p>
<p>The irony of the release will be celebrated by the HN community, the larger tech community, and sadly many of us in the API space. Yay! Another API! Hooray!! When in reality the API is purely a move to satisfy the myriad of scrapers who are harvesting content from the site in preparation for a site rework. Sorry developers the API isn&rsquo;t for you, it is just to scrape the scrapers off HN&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The release of the HN API shows exactly how APIs can be wielded for amplification of existing ideology, and are by no means good, or even neutral in online debates.</p>
<p>When a company is showcased as having an API, immediately be skeptical that there is more to the story, do your homework, then make a decision on your own, whether or not it is a good thing.</p>
