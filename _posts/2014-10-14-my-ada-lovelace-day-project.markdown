<p>Welcome to my Ada Lovelace Day project--building a machine readable list of the notable women in the history of compute. As I do with all of my work, I also want to introduce people to the world of APIs along the way, so building an API to help educate people about women in the history of compute was a great way to spend my day, and bring attention to this topic.</p>
<p>I spent the day researching the history of women in tech, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/gh-pages/data/people.json">compiled all of my research into a single machine readable JSON file</a>, that anyone can use. With this research available in a machine readable format, anyone can potentially syndicate the information available here on any website or mobile application, extending this important layer of our history to a wider audience.</p>
<p>You can stay in tune with my work here via the <a href="http://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">roadmap page</a>, and since I&rsquo;ve built this website using Github, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">you can submit comments and questions via the Github issue manager</a>, and if you are feeling brave, you can fork the project, edit any pages and submit a pull request to contribute to the project.</p>
