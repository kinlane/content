<p>I&rsquo;m going to be cutting back on traveling and speaking in the future, and if you are one of the folks who got an email from me, declining an engagement--I&rsquo;m sorry. I traveled a crazy amount in September, and put on <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of the month. I got sick during the downtime afterwards, and I just went to Stockholm to speak, where I got sick again&mdash;only just fully recovering as of  yesterday.</p>
<p>I feel like my most important work, which is my research, and secondarily my story telling suffers greatly when I travel, and takes an even greater hit when I&rsquo;m sick. When it comes to making an impact, and reaching the widest possible audience, I&rsquo;d say my writing is the most important. I get only a handful of people who come up to me and say &ldquo;great talk at that API event&rdquo;, where I get a steady flow of people who thank me for my writing, and tell me about the impact it has made on them.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I'm going to dramatically cut back on accepting speaking engagements, and attending conferences. There are a handful of events I&rsquo;m addicted to like <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a> and <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a> that I don't think I will ever stop going to, and of course my own conference <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> will continue, but beyond that I&rsquo;m going to need a damn good reason to go to an event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for being kind of a jerk on this front, but the API space is moving really quickly, and I feel like I can&rsquo;t afford to miss a beat when it comes to my monitoring, research, coding and writing. The ROI on traveling and speaking just isn't there, like it is with my writing&mdash;which is the most nourishing thing I have, when it comes to keep this crazy train moving forward.</p>
