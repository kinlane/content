title: 'Introducing Eclipse Che and Eclipse Cloud Development'
---
<hr /> This morning at EclipseCon Europe, we announced the creation of Eclipse Che, an open source platform for the creation of cloud development tooling. A large portion of Codenvy has been contributed as part of this project and we will have nearly 35 engineering resources dedicated to the ongoing improvement of Che.
Separately, the Eclipse Foundation has announced the formation of a new Top Level Project named Eclipse Cloud Development (ECD).  ECD is an initiative to create technologies, platforms, and tools necessary to enable the delivery of highly integrated cloud development and cloud developer environments. ECD includes Eclipse Che and also projects from IBM, SAP and Pivotal. There will be more than 50 engineers working on cloud development open source projects. We are proud and excited to be working alongside these incredible institutions.
Additionally, Codenvy has become a strategic member of the Eclipse Foundation, taking a board seat. 
Why have we made these moves?
We believe in the future of cloud development. Cloud development has the potential to turn organizations into lean, continuous operations and enable teams to release more frequently and ship faster. 
In order for cloud development to achieve global adoption, the technologies, platforms, and protocols used to deliver these solutions must achieve the following goals:
Today, we introduced a new Codenvy, a developer environment cloud, a commercially hosted and scalable Eclipse of Che. Codenvy has been adopted by developers, their teams, and devops groups within organizations in order to eliminate configuration and to automate the provisioning, sharing and scaling of environments. 
We envision Codenvy being used for any developer environment, whether in our public cloud or on-premises within enterprises. For enterprises to be comfortable with adopting such solutions, they seek out systems supported by their ISV partners and with IP vetted by governing bodies. 
Donating Codenvy to Eclipse and having the core system become Eclipse Che was a natural step. The Eclipse Foundation has a strong commitment to open source, a rigorous set of IP review processes, a large tool development and user communities, and active governance from large vendors like Google, IBM, RedHat, and SAP.
