<p>After you look at enough APIs, you start seeing beyond what is offered, and start getting an idea for what is missing, something that falls squarely in the area of what I dub the politics of APIs. What do I mean by what is missing? If you take a look at the data points a company has in its regular operations, and you compare what is offered via an API&mdash;the difference is what I&rsquo;m focused on.</p>
<p>As an exercise, let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="http://developer.att.com/">AT&amp;T API platform</a>, and see what resources they have made available via APIs. I will be focusing on other providers in the future, but I think AT&amp;T has thick enough skin (or could care less about what I say), to deal with my critique:</p>

</ul>
<p>When the context is just the AT&amp;T developer area, it is easy to applaud, and comment on what a nice stack this is. There are a number of pretty high value API resources, available in that list. It is when you zoom the context out, and consider the entire platform offerings, alongside what is being exposed via the AT&amp;T dev platform. I haven&rsquo;t done formal study of what services, and data points are available to me via my AT&amp;T cellular account, but at first glance, I notice that a handful of pretty critical elements are missing.</p>
<p>The most noticeable thing that is missing in this asssement of AT&amp;T resources, is my account. I&rsquo;m given access to my account identity, so that I can login to other external systems using my AT&amp;T identity, but I&rsquo;m not given access to all aspects of my account operations. Imagine if every aspect of my AT&amp;T account, billing, and payments were available via API? I would have a whole new world of options for comparing, managing, and staying in tune with my AT&amp;T usage, which from a political, and business standpoint is not something AT&amp;T is going to be an advocate for--the API stack above is not accident, sorry. ;-(</p>
<p>Consider the possibilities for auditing corporate mobile bills, or as an average user, let a 3rd party service help monitor my <a title="AT&amp;T Wireless Cramming From FCC" href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/att-pay-105-million-resolve-wireless-cramming-investigation-0">AT&amp;T cellphone bill for cramming, and other shady shit</a> that goes on behind the scenes. I&rsquo;m not saying APIs are a solution that will make everything better, but it definitely will let in some sunlight into the conversation&mdash;something that can potentially help balance the relationship between platforms and its developers, but most importantly bring end-users into the discussion.</p>
<p>Comparing what resources and data points a company offers via online services, alongside what is offered via APIs, is hard. This is something I&rsquo;m trying to understand more, and establishing matrixes for platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and AT&amp;T, is slowly helping me understand it better. Hopefully I can further integrate this approach into my regular monitoring, and provide ongoing stories about the politics of APIs, and how APIs are used (or not used) to empower the platform, consumers, and end-users, but more importantly the gaps that exist in how users data and resources are tracked vs. how they are truly made accessible.</p>
