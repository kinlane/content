title: 'This Reflects What It Felt Like For Me To Work In Washington D.C. Each Day'

<p>I was looking through <a href="http://m.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/2014-photos">President Obama's&nbsp;2014: A Year in Photos</a> today, and while many of the pictures evoke emotion for me, but this one in particular really summed up for me, the very short time I spent in Washington D.C., as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/meet-the-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>.</p>

<p>The number one lesson I walked away with from my time in Washington D.C., was a respect for the scope that exists is DC. Everything is big. Everything is under scrutiny. Everything is operating at a scale, I never had experienced before. If you think you get it, and have never worked there--you know nothing.</p>
<p>I respect anyone who can actually get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYTHING</span> done in this evironment--knowing this, I understand that my role is purely from the outside-in. I'm not saying everything there has the best possible motives, but you have to respect anyone getting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYTHING</span> done in an environment, where everything you do is being so heavily scrutinized.</p>
