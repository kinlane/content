<p>This is another post in my ongoing series of regular responses I give to people. Meaning when I get asked something so much, I craft blog posts that live on kinlane.com, and I reply to emails, tweets, etc. with a quick link to my standardized responses.</p>
<p>One I get less frequently, but still enough to warrant a response to, &ldquo;why are you so hard to get a hold of?"</p>
<p>To which the answer is, "I&rsquo;m not". I have a phone number that are very public, I have 3 emails all going into same inbox, a highly active Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Github presence. If you are having trouble getting a hold of me, it is because you are not using the right channels, or potentially the right frequency.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t talk on the phone. I schedule meetings, increasingly only on Thursdays (regularly for partners, etc.), where i talk on skype, ghangout, and occasionally the phone.  When I talk on these channels, I can do nothing else. I can&rsquo;t multi-task. I am present. If I did this all the time, I wouldn&rsquo;t be the API Evangelist&mdash;I&rsquo;d be that phone talker guy.</p>
<p>Second, I respond well to quick, concise emails, tweets, wall posts, and github issues. Shorter, the more concise the better. This is what I mean by frequency, if you send me a long-winded email, there is good chance it could be weeks or even never that will respond. Sorry, I just don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth for that frequency&mdash;I use short, precise signals.</p>
<p>I do not have a problem with someone being a &ldquo;phone person&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not, sorry. In my experience people who require lots of phone calls, also require lots of meetings, and often shift in their needs, because it isn&rsquo;t anchored to any specific outline, document, or project requirements. Personally I try to avoid these types of personalities, because they have proven some of the least efficient, and most demanding relationships in my professional life.</p>
<p>Please don't take this message the wrong way, I'm trying to help you be as successful as you can in making the right connection.</p>
