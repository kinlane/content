<p>I process my thoughts through stories on my blogs, and often times you'll find me bitching about people and companies here on kinlane.com. Other times you'll find me waxing poetic about how nice people can be&mdash;welcome to my bipolar blogging world.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to say how much I like finding nice emails from people in my inbox, especially when they don&rsquo;t want anything from me. Getting these nice notes from people, about specific stories, topics, or just generally thanking me for what I do, makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Ok, I'll stop gushing, but I just wanted to say thank you&mdash;you know who you are.</p>
