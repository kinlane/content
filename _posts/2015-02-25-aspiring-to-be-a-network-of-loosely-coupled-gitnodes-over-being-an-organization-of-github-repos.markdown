<p>This is some of my thoughts around a new design of a Docker driven micro-service that I'm contemlating deploying as part of my infrastructure. I depend on Github, in a big, big way. It runs all of my sites, web apps, and stores much of my super top secret code and algorithms&mdash;Github plays a pretty central role in overall API Evangelist operations.</p>
<p>When it comes to Git, Github, and the Github API I use less than 25% of the functionality available to me on the platform. I depend on the version and user control, pages hosting, and read, write, and delete pages through the API, as well as the Git interface.  As I ponder my plan B, and plan C option for my network, I&rsquo;m thinking about a design for a modular version of how I use Github, as a micro-service running in a Docker container.</p>
<p>This containerized version of how I use Github, would utilize Git, have a basic file system API, and use Jekyll as a CMS, all the goodness I would require in an independent node. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Github, but ever since hearing Mike Amundsen's (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) <a href="http://mce_host/admin/blog/SlideShare slideshare Upload  Hd-icn Login Signup  Home  Leadership  Technology  Education  Marketing  Design  More Topics Learn more Liberating the API Economy with Scale-Free Networks - Mike Amundsen, Director of API Architecture, API Academy @ APIdays Sydney    1 of 130    Liberating the API Economy with Scale-Free Networks - Mike Amundsen, Director of API Architecture, API Academy @ APIdays Sydney 69 views  CA API Management CA API Management (180 SlideShares)  Follow  5   0   0   0 Published on Feb 12, 2015  Liberating the API Economy with Scale-Free Networks &hellip;   Published in Technology   0 Comments  1 Like  Statistics  Notes   Post Be the first to comment   Transcript 1.

">talk in Sydney Australia</a>, a couple weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how I can evolve my platform to be series of nodes vs a hub.</p>
<p>I will call my new API driven, Git-centric, dockerized micro-service, Gitnode. When ready, i should be able to run my Gitnode anywhere I want. On my AWS, Google, or any other infrastructure I use to host my Docker containers. I predict I will still heavily use Github for many of my sites, but for some elements of my infrastructure, using a Githnode might make more sense.</p>
<p>I will design Gitnode as a standalone micro-service, that runs in Docker, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">as I'm doing with the rest of my stack</a>. I anticipate I will eventually have several variations of Gitnode, but for now, I just want to mimic the website hosting I achieve through Github, and from there I'll branch out.</p>
