title: 'I Have Gotten More Return On the Ideas I Have Set Free Than Any I Have Locked up'

<p>When I walkthrough the junkyard of startups, and business ideas in my mind, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that much of my current success with <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> has more to do with open ideas, than it does any other aspect. I have numerous startups under my belt, where I tried to capitalize on ideas I've had, ranging from selling wine online to real estate data, but nothing like what I'm doing now.</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of success along the way, but nothing that compares to the feelings of success I have with API Evangelist. Other than right place, and at right time, I cannot come up with much that is different from API Evangelist, and previous work&mdash;except the fact that API Evangelist is focused on opening up and freeing every idea that comes along.</p>
<p>This type of approach to business might not be right for everyone. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve also passed up on some pretty lucrative opportunities to monetize around my ideas, but in the end, I mostly enjoy making enough money to get by, and generating as much positive exhaust around my ideas as I can. I'm not saying all business needs to think like this, but the more API-centric your business is, I think the more you have to consider the repercussions of locking up ideas vs. setting them free.</p>
