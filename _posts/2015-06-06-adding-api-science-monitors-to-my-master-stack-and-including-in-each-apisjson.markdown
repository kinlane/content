title: 'Adding API Science Monitors To My Master Stack And Including In Each APIs.json'

<p>Machine readable <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> definitions have always been default for all my APIs, and including it in my APIs.json index is a must. <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">A while back I also started including links to my Postman collections I had generated using my Swagger definitions</a>. You never know when someone would rather have a Postman collection to get going over Swagger, or Swagger UI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going through <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">my master API stack</a> and doing some final adjustments to each API, and while I'm working through each of them I'm also generating API monitors using <a href="https://www.apiscience.com">API Science</a>. It is easy to generate the monitoris I need from my Swagger definitions, or even Postman Collections.</p>
<p>I've included a link to the status page where I embedded some API Science visualizations that pull real-time data from the monitors that I setup, in the APIs.json file for each API. I'm playing around with also adding a machine readable reference, along with the human consumable link to the code page. I'd like to see a link to code page, and machine readable index of all API availability, default for all APIs.</p>
<p>I only have API Science monitors generated for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/index.html">"API API"</a>, but will be working thorugh the other 24 APIs as I have time. I have some more work to do on this API, before I move on to the next API in my stack--the Audio API.</p>
