<p>While being far from perfect, I'm going to go ahead and open up my master stack of APIs to my ecosystem of developers. I've been waiting until I got my common service composition applied across all 30 APIs before I did. All 30 APIs have this applied, as well as a monitors to let me know if they are up or down.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, stabilizing some endpoints, but I feel comfortable opening up the public, and retail layer for anyone to use. I keep the POST, PUT, and DELETE resources available only to myself, partners, and trusted API consumers, so I'm pretty confident that the GET layer is ready for wider discussion (if anyone cares).</p>
<p>It will still take me a couple months to get everything in order, as I would expect from a proper API provider. I still have to work out the linkage between my master stack, and all the sub-stacks like API Evangelist. My goal is to list everything I produce under Kin Lane, but then organize and orchestrate them into more meaningful portals for specific purposes.</p>
<p>As of today, <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">you can sign up for an account, obtain application keys, and use your key for retail access to all my resources</a>, and let me know if you need something more.</p>
