<p>I've been doing API Evangelist for a while now. Most of the time I can make this work, and honestly sometimes I just fucking rock it. Right now, I keep stumbling and falling on my face. I've written the same amount of posts I usually do, but none of them are worthy of posting.</p>
<p>I also find many of the conversations I engage in, I'm overly aggressive--which goes against what I'm about. I'm not apologizing for anything, cause I would ever do anything I don't back up 100%. I just am not my usual self, and I am having trouble figuring out why.</p>
<p>It would be easy to blame some corporate forces that are pissing me off right now, and people co-opting my work, without any recognition, or return to community. Honestly this has happened throughout the last five years, and I have nobody to blame but myself.</p>
<p>I always find a way to work through the doldrums, finding my way back to the center. This particular moment the currents seem a little swifter than normal, and I cannot figure out why. I trust that I will figure this shit out, I just wanted to put out there that I'm working on it.</p>
<p>I cherish my readers, and thrive on shedding light on what is going on. I hope this is just me, and not a signal of what is to come. It is easier if I'm to blame. ;-) See you on the flip-side.</p>
