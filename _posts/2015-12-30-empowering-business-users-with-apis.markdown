title: 'Empowering Business Users With APIs'
---
<p>If you know me, you know I am big on making sure "the normals" all know about APIs. I made it my mission in 2010, and 2016 I will continue to focus on this area. Last year you heard me talk a lot about how anyone could deploy APIs, using Zapier, Google, and Restlet, something I will continue this year, but you will also hear me step it up, focusing on the average business users.</p>
