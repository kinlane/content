<p>There are wide range of motivations of why organizations DO NOT have APIs, ranging from just not knowing about APIs, to companies who have them, but refuse to open them up to end-users, and everything in between. API Activist is my general catch-all bucket for storing organizations I come across, no matter which category they fall into--I will work to document the many different dimensions, as the project evolves.</p>
<p>The first four organizations I added as targets I think represent some of the common reasons out there today:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</strong> - Most likely do not know about APIs, and once educated will most likely see the potential. I'm guessing funding of the work will become the big issue, but is also something I'd like to focus API Activist on making happen--bringing resources to the table.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn -</strong> Classic API platform who is looking to use APIs for their platform advantage, and is not really interested in the community. LinkedIn has APIs, but they are notoriously closed, and is something that is getting even more restricted as times goes on.</li>
<li><strong>Snapchat -</strong> Snapchat has APIs, but do not have a public API program. Additionally Snapchat has had security issues introduced because they do not have formal program. The Snapchat team has ade it clear they do not get the modern API movement, and understand the importance of them.</li>
<li><strong>Alarm.com -</strong> A representation of the growing number of Internet connected devices coming to market who all have APIs, but do not make them available to the public. It is hard to tell why companies are not interested in doing this, but maybe they will with a little motivation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be more reasons to emerge, now that I have a place to put organizations I find, but I think these four are a good cross section of organizations that are proving resistant to APIs. I am guessing it will take a lot of work to convince LinkedIn and Snapchat of the possibilities, but I'd expect the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse will be much easier, with Alarm.com probably being somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I am just getting started with <a href="http://apiactivist.com">API Activist</a>, and as I had more examples, get more people involved, and work some on these targets, I am sure I will learn a lot. So...more to come, and if you want to get involved, or suggest a target, <a href="https://github.com/api-activist/master/issues">use the issue management for this master repository</a>.</p>
