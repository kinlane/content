<p>As the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I'm obviously biased about the importance of APIs. When APIs are done right, they can bring some significant benefits any organization, partners, public, and the overall sectors that they operate within. As more of our personal and professional lives move online, access to data is growing more critical, and APIs are part of one possible solution.</p>
<p>I do not believe APIs are a miracle cure, but when you do them right, and include critical building blocks like <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>, they can be a great tool for managing secure, but open access to vital content and resources. API Evangelist has always been about helping business, organizational, institutional, and government leaders understand the potential of APIs, and educating them about best practices. While this has been very successful, I realized last year that some companies will need a little more encouragement before the understand the importance of having APIs, and <a href="http://apiactivist.com/">API Activist</a> was born.</p>
<p>I needed a place to gather my thoughts around organizations that I felt should have an API. From leading mobile application providers, to the growing wave of connected hardware manufacturers, and all the way to city, state, or federal government. In addition to my own thoughts, I also need a place to gather the requests I get from my readers, like this one today from Tim McGee:</p>

<p>I get these a lot, and I often just add them to a notebook, retweet them, occasionally write a story, and then move on. I need a domain where I can centralize a list of these requests for APIs and hopefully aggregate anything else we can that might influence organizations around the importance of APIs, and "encourage" them to make APIs more open and accessible.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I don't feel APIs should be mandatory. I think organizations should understand the benefits they bring the table, how they can play broker between an organization, its partners, with the public, and potentially the government when it applies--then decide for themselves. I will use my <a href="https://github.com/api-activist">API Activist Github organization</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-activist/master">master site repo</a>, as a bucket to throw all my requests, and those of my readers. Hopefully with time, I can encourage the public to join in, using the native Github platform, move each project forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now it consists of this <a href="http://apiactivist.com/">website</a>, a <a href="http://apiactivist.com/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="http://apiactivist.com/companies.html">list of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies</a> that are targets. For each target, eventually I will setup an individual repository, to house all research, JSON data files, and use the repositories issue management for conversation around the project. If there is a project you'd like to see, <a href="https://github.com/api-activist/master/issues">you can submit via the master API Activist issue management system</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Tim, for motivating to move this project forward another step.</p>
