title: 'Can You Help Me With The ClinicalTrials.gov Data?'

<p>I received an email from someone at the University of Miami, who had seen my Adopta.Agency presentation in Pittsburgh, and was looking for some help adopting the data available at <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. As soon as I dug into the information on the download page, it was clear that this was a perfect candidate for adoption.</p>
<p>I thought the original comments from the email are very relevant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am working on a project that uses data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/ .</em><br /><em>Their API is crap to say the least. </em><br /><em>I was wondering if you could help me out. Is there a tool I could use to get better access to the data?</em><br /><em>If we download the entire thing is an 850MB zipped file in XML.</em><br /><em>I only need a fraction of the trials in the db.</em><br /><em>I guess I am looking for advice on how to proceed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This is why I started doing Adopta.Agency. There are thousands of data sets available out there for me to adopt. It helps when I have folks reach out, pointing me to specific high value datas ets, that they need access to, so that they can solve a specific problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations just do not think through the release, presentation, and usability of their open data work. Simple making things available as CSV, and JSON download, as well as evolving a very usable set of APIs, can go a long, long way in encouraging people to do important work around the valuable data and content.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the entire database file for the clinical trials, and will be getting to work to process it, and make available via CSV, JSON, and as an API.&nbsp;</p>
