<p>Ok. That concludes the first sprint around the <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/clinical-trials/documentation/?swagger_url=http://adopta-agency.github.io/clinical-trials/openapi-spec/complete.json">clinical trials API</a>. I achieved API, and JSON + CSV downloads. The project is setup, and there is a feedback loop. There is no reason for me to move things forward, without more feedback.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't know much about the data, or how it will be used. This is why I do <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency projects</a>. To help bring attention to valuable open data sets, and encourage conversation amongst people who can actually put the data to real use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a developer it is easy for me to start adding end points to the API, based upon what I think is needed, but really without some domain expertise, and the ability to sovle some real world problems, my perspective means nothing. My role is to get the data out of the bar delimited zipped up files, and potentially let the sunlight in with CSV, and JSON files, as well as using an API.</p>
<p>I'm going to go back to the folks who initially brought my attention to the data set, and see what they need, and hopefully get them to step in and help be stewards of this project. I am happy to add some more API endpoints, maybe to pull data by state, topic area, or other meaningful criteria, but I need direction.</p>
<p>This is the API journey, something that is more about finding ways to deliver solutions using open data, that are meaningful to real people, than it is about the open data formats, technology used, or that APIs being put to work.</p>
