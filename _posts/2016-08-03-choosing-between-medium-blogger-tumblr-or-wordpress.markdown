<p>There are many differences between the leading blogging platforms like Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger. Different types of bloggers will view these solutions in different ways, with very different reasons behind why they (we) do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these blogging platforms has their pros and cons, and bring a variety of network effects with them. Medium has definitely been dominating the conversation lately, but Blogger and WordPress still provide&nbsp;very robust solutions, even after well over a decade of serving up content.</p>
<p>If its plugins that you are looking for...choose WordPress, and if it is the network effect you desire, consider Tumblr or Medium. Whichever one you choose, the most important thing you can do is make sure your blog is available on your own domain. Make sure you have your content within your own domain, even if you are working to leverage one of these company's platforms.</p>
<p>You never know when you will want to migrate your blog, or do away with the blog altogether, and when you do not have control over the domain, this is much, much harder to do.</p>
