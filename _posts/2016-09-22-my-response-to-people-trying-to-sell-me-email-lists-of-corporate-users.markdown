<p>If you are in the business of technology like I am, you probably get the random emails from people trying to sell contacts from leading technology companies. They are usually pretty savvy at getting past SPAM filters&nbsp;and are persistent at trying to sell the information of leading companies from SalesForce, Microsoft, Amazon, and pretty much any other company out there.</p>
<p>Like most of the SPAM in my inbox, I just flag and move on, which I have done with these types of emails, but they keep coming, so I crafted a template email to send back to them, like I do with many of the solicitations I get (I have a folder of templates).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thank you for your unwanted solicitation. I hope you are doing well (I do not care, but this is what you do right?) I'm in the business of being a human in the technology space, not making a profit off of selling other people's information, but hell there is good money in it right?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Would you be interested in buying the contact information of people who sell other people's contact information? You see, I track the IP address and other details of every email I receive trying to sell me contacts. I then conduct research on who they are, discovering their name, home address, phone number, and where their children </em>go<em> to school.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you think this is a good thing to do, and would like to buy these from me, please send me $$$$. Cause I'm greedy bitches. Please go the fuck away and get a life.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sincerely,</em></p>

<p>I'm sure many of these people are just poor people doing the bidding of some pretty sleezy people who think this is a good business idea. I can't help but push back, especially when they get through the filters and take moments of my time away. Even though it is just seconds, it is still my valuable time.</p>
<p>I know that not everyone can find employment that is ethical and worthy of being proud of, but maybe I can scare a handful of folks to look for employment elsewhere, and move on. If not, at least I'm having fun, and I feel a little better.</p>
