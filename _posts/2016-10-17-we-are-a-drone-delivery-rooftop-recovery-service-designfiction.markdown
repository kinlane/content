<p>With the increase in drone delivery companies, the demand for our services has grown by 500%. Most of the time we are just coming to retrieve a pizza, a burrito, or grocery delivery. Other times it is something more expensive like a phone, laptop, or other device. People just don't have ladders, or physically can't do it safely, and this is where we come in.</p>
<p>Most of the time our employees can get on a roof without the aid of a ladder or other gear&nbsp;but are also are equipped for even the most complicated of situations. We've scaled skyscrapers, hung off bridges, and scaled trees--we can get the pizza off the roof of your two story house. Save yourself the hospital bill, and let our trained personnel do the dangerous work.</p>
<p>Each house call is $25.00, but you sign up for a membership it can be as low as $7.00 per visit with a long term commitment. Usually, after the 3rd time we come out for a visit, people become full members. Apparently drone delivery isn't living up to the hype, and our homes just weren't intended for access from above. Drone operators keep promising things will get better, but our numbers show that it is only something that is getting worse--whatever, we are happy to help.</p>
