<p>I want to be able to share each comic strip generated as part of teh jigz up using social media. Each strip should have a set of Facebook and Twitter sharing buttons, and when they are clicked it should give the option to select from each available frame--default will be the first one.</p>
<p>When shared, it will share a static snapshot of each slide as a single image. The Tweet or Facebook wall post will have the name of the episode plus the title of the slide, with the image representation for the slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still not sure how I'll do the image capture for this, but I will figure it out. It will be key to the sharing, and other storytelling features I'd like to see present on this site. I'm just documenting this as part of the updates, so I can reference as I am building out these features. I'll use this as a guide to evolve the project as I have the time.</p>
