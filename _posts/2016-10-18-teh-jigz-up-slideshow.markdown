<p>This is the last entry for tonight. In the future I want to be able to roll these comic strips up as a slideshow or some sort of video and vine, and shared to Facebook, and Twitter. Each&nbsp;comic strip should be shareable, allowing people to come visit the website, or published as a slideshow, so people can experience the full story on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>I will be building on top of an image capture solution I will develop for the sharing features, which will have to take an image snapshot of each frame of a comic strip and then assemble as an animated gif, or other media format required. My goal is to provide a way to roll up each comic into a portal media package that can be shared, embedded, and experienced on any site.</p>
<p>Again, I am just sharing this as an update so that I remember what the hell I was thinking the last time I was working on this project. This way, the next time I sit down to work on this, everything I was thinking is right here where I need it. Next, I'll work on finishing up the styling for each frame, and get to work on the image capture.</p>
