<p>Each jig is driven by a Google Spreadsheet (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fC-sIVuUnKJl-0ZCqDrJPLDs6-86MNVm86RrHwYtjoI/edit#gid=0">here is current one</a>), allowing for easy editing of each comic strip. Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds&nbsp;to a cell in the comic strip. Right now each strip is limited to six frames, but this will be expanded upon in the future. Each frame has the following properties to manage the content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title -</strong> The title for the frame.</li>
<li><strong>Text One </strong>- A text blob to say something.</li>
<li><strong>Text One Style -</strong> A CSS style for text.</li>
<li><strong>Text Two -</strong>&nbsp;A text blob to say something.</li>
<li><strong>Text Two Style -</strong> &nbsp;A CSS style for text.</li>
<li><strong>Image One </strong>- An image to display.</li>
<li><strong>Image One Width </strong>- A width for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Image One Style</strong> - A CSS style for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Image Two -</strong> Second image to display</li>
<li><strong>Image Two Width </strong>-&nbsp;A width for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Image Two Style -</strong>&nbsp;A CSS style for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Background Color -</strong> A background hex color for the&nbsp;frame.</li>
<li><strong>Background Image -</strong> A background image for the&nbsp;frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now the editing of each cell is manual, and if not used just leave empty. The idea is to be able to quickly provide some text, an image, and some styling to produce each frame. Eventually, I'd like to establish a way to quickly pull from an image gallery, and easier styling than the CSS I have in there now--moving towards something like left bottom, right top, etc -- more plain english.</p>
<p>I am just documenting the process&nbsp;so that the story behind is available for anyone to review&nbsp;if they want to fork it. I find it helps to have the story recorded in real-time, makes for a more complete pacakge.</p>
