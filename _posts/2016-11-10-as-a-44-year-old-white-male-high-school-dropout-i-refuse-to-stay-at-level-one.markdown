title: 'As A 44 Year Old White Male High School Dropout I Refuse To Stay At Level One'
---
<p>I keep hearing how the democratic party alienated this whole group of white men, who ended up voting for Trump. The diplomatic, fence menders in my world point out that we should have spoken to this demographic more. First, I'm not a big fan of the democratic party principles, but I exercise this in other blog posts, as I work to come to grips with what happened--I wanted to talk about the focus on this group of white men first.</p>

<p>I am a 44 year old white heterosexual male, who in my life has had numerous times to give up, and whine about the hard place I find myself in. It could have been when I got kicked out of high school by my conservative principle who didn't like my hippie famly&nbsp;ways. It could have been in the early 1990's when I developed a taste for drugs, including heroin. It could have been when my startup partners wrote me out of the companies success after the first dot com bubble. Maybe when my wife cheated on me and divorced me, and took both my houses. In short, I could have chosen to give up and blame my government for leaving me behind at any point, in any particular administration -- it was Clinton, it was Bush, no it was Obama!!</p>
<p>No, it was me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the one who got myself out of the ditch each time. It was me who decided to become the technology professional I am who decided to not fall for the latest wave of bullshit American dream promises coming out of Silicon Valley, and learn to own my own data, content, and figure out how to monetize this expertise to get ahead. I chose to not use drugs in excess anymore, and get a handle on my drinking before it killed me. I chose to eat better, and realize the impact it had on my performance. I chose to read, learn, and grow. I chose...</p>
<p>It is a sad story that us white guys are having such a hard time, and feel like we are owed by society and government--that we believed the promises that were whispered in our privileged ear. I refuse to spend the next four years trying to convince "my people" of how they should vote. I am going to focus on the younger generation, helping them understand how to take control of their physical and digital worlds, and the importance of them getting out to vote, and being an active political player. I refuse to play the sad violin for the white dudes who continue to drive us into the ditch, and focus on empowering women, people of color, and the youth take the wheel.</p>
