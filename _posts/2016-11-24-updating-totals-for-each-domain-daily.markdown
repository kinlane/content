title: 'Updating Totals for Each Domain Daily'
---
<p>To better understand how things are working, as well as the scope of each domain I'm profiling I wanted to regularly update the numbers for the number of URLs indexed, and how many of them have had their Facebook shares pulled. I run this hourly&nbsp;so that&nbsp;I can get updated number of URLs and shares on a regular basis (daily at least).</p>
<p>If the numbers work out, I should be able to pull the Facebook shares weekly, and eventually identify trending numbers for each URL, across all the domains. Eventually, I'll establish a way to stop pulling for URLs that aren't trending, do not have any shares, and are just too old, or not relevant--it will just take time and refinement.</p>
<p>These totals for each domain will drive <a href="https://github.com/domain-literacy/website/issues/3">a reporting tool that I have planned</a>. I want to easily allow for comparison of one or many domains across both the news and propaganda repositories. Eventually, I'll develop a variety of visual tools to help make sense of the data being pulled across all domains targeted by the system.</p>
