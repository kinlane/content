title: 'Taking A A Look At The Content Exchange Platform'
---
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oddi_logo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I thought the Content Exchange Platform API from the Office of Digital Design & Innovation, out of the Broadcasting Board of Governors was an interesting API to profile as part of my work to augment API and open data efforts out of the US government.Â </p>
<p>I wanted to craft an OpenAPI Spec, and APIs.json index of the API and profile as part of my work and help highlight that it exists. Maybe it will encourage more investment in it, as well as help provides a snapshot of it, in case it goes away.</p>
<p>I couldn't actually make a successful API call to the endpoint listed, so maybe it is already falling into disrepair. I will circle back around when I can and spend some more time trying to understand the data, and content that was made available via the API.</p>
