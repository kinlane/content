title: 'Opportunity In Breaking Up Videos Into Separate Images'
---
<p>I have been working my way through about 300 GB of drone and GoPro videos from this summer. One of the lingering thoughts I was having throughout this process centered around the concept of breaking videos up into individual slides. Once I stumbled across <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter">Algorithmia's Deep Learning</a>, I found myself thinking about how I could break up videos into separate images, and apply algorithmic texture filters to each individual image, and then reassemble back into a video.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> stood out as the solution I needed to accomplish this. It was pretty easy to export each video as separate .jpg files, as well as the ability to assemble any images into a video. What did take me some time was getting the frame rate, size, and other finer aspects of video to work as I desired, and in sync with my drone videos. To achieve an acceptable video I needed 60 individual images for each second of video, potentially making the work a compute and storage intensive endeavor.</p>
<p>Using Amazon EC2 and S3 it isn't too much work to leverage FFMPEG to break up videos into separate images. Once I did this, I started publishing a JSON representation of each video, along with each individual image to Github, leverage version control, forking, and the other benefits of the platform, but for use in managing a video, instead of code. This process has given each of my videos, a machine readable, Git managed the representation of each video for me to work with, manipulate, and evolve independently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you combine the separation of video, with Github in this way, with an API-driven&nbsp;approach to separation, assembly, as well as individual and overall image manipulation, the possibilities are pretty limitless. After I separate out each video into images, I am then applying textures and filters to each individual image using Algorithmia's deep filters, a process that has numerous opportunities, but I think the wider approach holds more potential than just fun filters. This approach is the primary reason I did this work. Playing with the videos, filters, and images was a welcome distraction, but I think the opportunity around breaking up videos into separate images is much bigger than <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work">algorithmic rotoscope</a>.</p>
