title: 'It Is Not The Technology: API Monitoring Means You Care'
---
<p>I was just messing around with a friend online about monitoring of our monitoring tools, where I said that I have a monitor setup to monitor whether or not I care about monitoring. I was half joking, but giving a shit is a pretty critical component of monitoring if you think about it. Nobody monitors something they don't care about. While monitoring in the world of APIs might mean a variety of things, I'm guessing that caring about those resources is a piece of every monitoring configuration.</p>
