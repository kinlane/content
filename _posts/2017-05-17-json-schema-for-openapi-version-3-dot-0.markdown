We are inching closer to a final release of version 3.0 of the OpenAPI specification, with the official version currently at 3.0.0-rc1. We are beginning to see tooling emerge, and services like [APIMATIC are already supporting version 3.0 when it comes to SDK generation](https://apimatic.io/), as well their [API Transformer conversion tool](https://apimatic.io/transformer). 

I am working on an OpenAPI validation solutions tailored specifically for municipal API deployments and was working with [the JSON Schema for version 2.0 of the API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json).  I wanted to help make my work be as ready for the future of the API specification and wanted to see if there was a JSON Schema for version 3.0 of the OpenAPI specification.
