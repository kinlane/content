I am in the process of eliminating the MySQL backend behind much of my research, eliminating a business expense, as well as an unnecessary complexity in my architecture. There really is no reason for the data I use in my business to be in a database. Nothing I track on tends to go beyond 10K rows, with most of the tables being less than 100 rows--perfect for spreadsheets, and my new static approach to delivering APIs, and websites for my research.
