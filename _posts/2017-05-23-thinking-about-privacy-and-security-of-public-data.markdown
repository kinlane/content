When I suggest modern approaches to API management be applied to public data I always get a few open data folks who push back saying that public data shouldn't be locked up, and needs to always be publicly available--as the open data gods intended. I get it, and I agree that public data should be easily accessible, but there are increasingly a number of unintended consequences that data stewards need to consider before they publish public data to the web.

I'm going through this exercise with my recommendations and guidance for municipal 211 operators when it comes to implementing Open Referral's Human Services Data API (HSDA). The schema and API definition centers around the storage and access to organizations, locations, services, contacts, and other key data for human services offered in any city--things like mental health resources, suicide assistance, food banks, and other things we humans need on a day to day basis. 

This data should be publicly available, and easy to access. We want people to find the resources they need at the local level--this is the mission. However, once you get to know the data, you start understanding the importance that not everything is 100% public by default. When you come across listings Muslim faith, and LGBTQ services, or possibly domestic violence shelters, and maybe needle exchanges. They are numerous types of listings where we need to be having sincere discussions around security and privacy concerns, and possibly think twice about publishing all or part of a dataset.
