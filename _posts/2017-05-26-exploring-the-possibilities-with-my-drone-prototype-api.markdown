I enjoy playing with what is possible with APIs without all the overhead of actually operating the APIs. I've been exploring the world of drones over the last year and is something that has collided with my API research, leaving me intrigued by what is possible with drone APIs, as I keep track on what existing drone providers are doing when it comes to APIs. 

Drones are the poster child for the Internet of Things. They collect video, take pictures, track location, and best of all--they fly!! Drones have APIs and consume APIs. You can deploy APIs in the cloud, on mobile devices and controllers, as well as on the drones themselves. Adding an entirely new dimension, you can connect a variety of other IoT devices to the drones, things like infrared and network detection, further pushing forward the possibilities.

Drones represent the IoT opportunity--both good and bad. The fun stuff, and the really, really scary stuff. Like the rest of the API space, I am fascinated by drones and APIs, and I want to understand what all the providers are doing. I want to aggregate all this knowledge and share what I learn as stories on API Evangelist, and also play with what I would like to see emerge in the API space--without actually having to be responsible for making it happen. I needed a safe space I could play. 

I'm pushing forward my usage of Jekyll and Github to help me play with a new way to prototype APIs, mock their functionality, but also emulate the operations around the APIs. I created
