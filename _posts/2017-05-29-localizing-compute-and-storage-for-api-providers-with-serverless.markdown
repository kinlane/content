title: Localizing Compute And Storage For API Providers With Serverless

[Twilio launched their Twilio Function this last week](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/05/introducing-twilio-functions.html), localizing serverless infrastructure for Twilio API consumers. It seems like a logical move for mature API providers, keeping in tune with shifts in how developers are integrating with APIs, and deploying their applications in a DevOps, continuous integration environment.

I could see other API providers following TWilios lead, jumping on the serverless bandwagon, and localizing compute within their ecosystems. I can see this approach merging with other evolution in the SDK space where service providers like APIMATIC are enabling the continuous deployment of SDKs, samples, and other scripts for API integration. Allowing developer to quickly deploy integration scripts, in the programming language of choice--all baked into their API platform developer account.
