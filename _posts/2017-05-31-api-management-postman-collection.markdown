I have been encouraging API providers to publish and manage their API definitions using Github similar to how you'd manage any code. Companies like Box and NY Times are publishing their OpenAPI definitions to a single repository, allowing partners and API consumers to pull the latest version of the API definition and use throughout the API lifecycle.

I stumbled across another example of managing your API definitions using Github, but this time it is the [management of your Postman Collections in a Github repo from API management provider Apigee](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-management-api-postman) (now Google).
