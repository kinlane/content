One way to help API developers understand API design is to provide them with a design guide, helping set a standard for how APIs should be designed across an organization or group. Another way to help developers follow best practices when it comes to API design is to provide them with a working example to follow when developing their API(s). In my experience people learn API design best practices through following what they know--they emulate the solutions they know.

Hang on to that thought, cause now I'm going to blow your mind. You know how API providers learn how to provide API design guide and working examples? By showcasing working examples companies, institutions, and government agencies publishing API design guides, working APIs, and portal prototypes. So that other API providers can learn by example! BOOM! Mind blown. An example of this can be found over at the General Service Administration (GSA), [with their API standards guide, API prototype, and forkable API portal and documentation](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/)--complete with the essential API building blocks.

Their simple approach to providing a working example of their [API standards](https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api/blob/master/standards.md) is refreshing. They have taken an existing GSA data set and launched a prototype API, then they published the API in a complete, working example of not just API, but an [API developer portal](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template) with all the essential building blocks of a basic API presence.

* [Getting Started](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/getting_started.html) - What you need to get started with the API.
* [Documentation](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/console/) - OpenAPI driven interactive API documentation.
* [Schema](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/fields.html) - A reference of the fields / schema used for API responses.
* [FAQ](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/FAQ.html) - Some basic questions about the API, and more importantly the API prototype.
* [Contact Info](https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/contact_us.html) - Using Github issues for support, with an accompanying email.

[The whole things runs on Github so it is forkable](https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation). What is great is they also have the source code for the API on Github, essentially providing a working, forkable representation of what is expected in the GSA API design guide. This is how you plant seeds for consistent API design across an organization. An API design guide setting standard, with a working example of what you would like to see.
